Many jurisdictions require annual benchmarking submissions separate from (or in addition to) BPS compliance. Abisko tracks submission requirements and deadlines for each property.

## Common Submission Requirements

| Jurisdiction | Requirement | Deadline | Platform |
|--------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| NYC | LL84 Benchmarking | May 1 | ESPM + NYC |
| Boston | BERDO Reporting | April 15 | ESPM + BERDO |
| DC | BEPS Reporting | April 1 | ESPM + DC |
| California | AB 802 | June 1 | ESPM + CEC |

## Submission vs Compliance

| Aspect | Benchmarking Submission | BPS Compliance |
|--------|------------------------|----------------|
| **What** | Report energy data | Meet performance target |
| **When** | Annual | Ongoing obligation |
| **Penalty for missing** | Fines, public listing | Much larger fines |
| **Data source** | ESPM → Jurisdiction | Same data, different use |
