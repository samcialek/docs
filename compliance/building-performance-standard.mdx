A Building Performance Standard (BPS) is a local law requiring buildings above a certain size to meet energy or emissions performance thresholds, typically with escalating targets over time and financial penalties for non-compliance.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM provides the data BPS laws require. Abisko tracks which properties are subject to which laws, calculates compliance status, and projects future penalties based on current performance.

## Major US Building Performance Standards

| Jurisdiction | Law Name | Threshold | Key Dates |
|--------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **New York City** | Local Law 97 | 25,000+ sq ft | 2024, 2030 targets |
| **Boston** | BERDO 2.0 | 20,000+ sq ft | 2025, 2030, 2050 |
| **Washington DC** | BEPS | 10,000+ sq ft | 2021, 2026 cycles |
| **Colorado** | BPS | 50,000+ sq ft | 2027 start |
| **Maryland** | BPS | 35,000+ sq ft | 2025+ by county |

## How BPS Laws Work

```
Phase 1 (2024-2029): 
  - Target: 50 kgCO2/m²
  - Your building: 55 kgCO2/m²
  - Status: Non-compliant
  - Penalty: $268/tonne CO2 over limit

Phase 2 (2030+):
  - Target: 30 kgCO2/m²
  - Stricter requirements, higher penalties
```

<Warning>
**LL97 Penalties:** Starting 2024, NYC buildings pay $268 per metric ton of CO2 over their limit. A 100,000 sq ft office building could face $100,000+ annual fines.
</Warning>

## Compliance Pathways

Most BPS laws offer multiple compliance routes:

| Pathway | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Prescriptive** | Meet specific EUI/emissions target | High performers |
| **Performance** | Show % improvement over baseline | Improving buildings |
| **Alternative** | Purchase offsets, renewable energy | Near-threshold |
| **Hardship** | Extension due to financial burden | Documented cases |

<Tip>
**Early Action:** Many BPS laws have lower targets now that increase over time. Meeting early targets builds buffer for stricter future limits.
