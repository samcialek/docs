ASHRAE Standard 100 provides energy efficiency targets for existing buildings based on building type and climate zone. It's used by some jurisdictions as the basis for building performance standards.

## What ASHRAE 100 Provides

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **EUI targets** | kBtu/sq ft by building type |
| **Climate adjustment** | Targets vary by ASHRAE climate zone |
| **Property types** | Office, retail, lodging, healthcare, etc. |
| **Compliance paths** | Prescriptive and performance options |

## ASHRAE 100 vs ENERGY STAR

| Aspect | ASHRAE 100 | ENERGY STAR |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Approach** | Absolute targets | Relative percentile |
| **Basis** | Engineering standards | Statistical comparison |
| **Result** | Pass/fail against target | Score 1-100 |
| **Adjustments** | Climate zone | Multiple operational factors |

<Tip>
**Use Case:** ASHRAE 100 is often referenced in building codes and performance standards. Check if your jurisdiction uses ASHRAE 100 targets for BPS compliance.
