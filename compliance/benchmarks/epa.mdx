EPA's ENERGY STAR program provides the most widely used building benchmarking system in the United States through Portfolio Manager. Buildings scoring 75 or above can earn ENERGY STAR certification.

## ENERGY STAR Score

The 1-100 score indicates how efficiently your building uses energy compared to similar buildings nationwide:

| Score | Meaning | Percentile |
|-------|---------|------------|
| 75-100 | Top quartile | Better than 75% |
| 50 | Median | Average |
| 25 | Bottom quartile | Better than only 25% |

## How the Score Is Calculated

```
Your Building's Source EUI
    ↓
Compared to expected EUI based on:
- Building type
- Size (GFA)
- Operating hours
- Worker density
- Climate zone
- Special features
    ↓
Result: Percentile ranking (1-100)
```

## ENERGY STAR Certification

To earn certification:
- Score of 75 or higher
- Must be verified by a licensed Professional Engineer
- Annual renewal required
