CBECS (Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey) is a national survey conducted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) that provides statistical data on energy consumption in commercial buildings.

## What CBECS Provides

| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Energy consumption** | By fuel type and end use |
| **Building characteristics** | Size, age, type, systems |
| **Regional data** | Census division breakdowns |
| **Intensity metrics** | EUI by building category |

## CBECS Data Uses

- **Baseline comparison:** How does my building compare to national averages?
- **Portfolio analysis:** Statistical context for your buildings
- **Research:** Academic and policy research on building energy

## CBECS vs ENERGY STAR

| Aspect | CBECS | ENERGY STAR |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Data source** | Statistical survey | Voluntary submissions |
| **Sample** | Nationally representative | Self-selected high performers |
| **Update** | Every 4-5 years | Continuous |
| **Building level** | Aggregated statistics | Individual building score |
