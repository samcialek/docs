Non-compliance with building performance standards results in financial penalties that can be significant for large buildings or portfolios.

## Penalty Structures by Jurisdiction

| Jurisdiction | Penalty Rate | Calculation |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **NYC LL97** | $268/tonne CO2 | Per tonne over limit |
| **Boston BERDO** | TBD | Under development |
| **DC BEPS** | $7.50/sq ft | For non-compliant |
| **Colorado** | TBD | Starting 2027 |

## Example Penalty Calculation

```
NYC Office Building:
- Size: 100,000 sq ft
- Limit: 8.46 kgCO2/sq ft (846 tonnes total)
- Actual: 10.00 kgCO2/sq ft (1,000 tonnes total)
- Excess: 154 tonnes
- Penalty: 154 × $268 = $41,272/year
```

<Warning>
**Escalating Targets:** Penalties will increase as targets tighten in 2030 and beyond. A building compliant today may face penalties in the next phase.
