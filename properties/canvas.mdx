Abisko enables users to effectively annotate, tag and organize information for different purposes within a property. This includes searchable, time-based **notes** as well as a flexible **canvas** for more free-form annotations and checklists.

## Canvas

The **Canvas** widget allows users to collaboratively manage free-form (non–time-based) notes and checklists in a shared workspace where all users can easily view and edit content.

<Tip>
  The **Canvas** is useful for jotting down ideas associated with the property and for quickly creating checklists of small tasks that other users can easily view, track and interact with.
</Tip>

For example, the canvas can be used to track:

- **Utility meter sync workflows**
  - _Checklists for verifying credentials and data flows_
- **Ideas related to decarbonization strategies**
  - _Bullet points of proposed decarbonization measures_
- **Generic notes about the property**
  - _External IDs, credentials, notes_

## Use the Canvas

- **Navigate to Property → Click on 'Canvas' button in the property banner (top-right)**
  - **To add a note**
    1. Click on the first blank row on the canvas
    1. Type ' / ' to view keyboard shortcut or click the ' + ' icon that appears to the left of the row over which the mouse hovers

       <Note>
         It can take a little practice to learn how to properly format different styles of notes in the property canvas, but once learned, it opens many possibilities for collaboration.
       </Note>
    3. Select the format for your note
       - e.g. text, header, bullet list, checklist
    2. Fill out the note
