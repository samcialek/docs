Data completeness represents the ratio of days with available utility data to the total number of days for which data is expected. This is a time-based metric that enables users to quickly understand the extent to which performance metrics represent complete data.

| **Rating** | **Data Completeness Value** | **Gap Days over Reporting Period** |
| :--------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Excellent  | 97-100%                     | Less than 12 Days                  |
| Good       | 92-97%                      | Between 12-20 Days                 |
| Passable   | 83-92%                      | Between 30-60 Days                 |
| Poor       | 66-83%                      | Between 60-120 Days                |
| Very Poor  | 0-66%                       | More than 120 Days                 |

## How It's Calculated

Data Completeness (%) is calculated at multiple levels:

- **Meter**: Every meter has a data completeness (%) for each 12-month reporting period as well as for the entirety of the meter activation period (i.e. all-time).
- **Property**: Every property has a data completeness (%) for each 12-month reporting period  for each utility type and subtype aggregated across all meters, including:
  - **Energy**: Total Energy, Total Electricity, Total Fuel, Total District Heating & Cooling
  - **Emssions**: Total Emissions, Direct Emissions, Indirect Emissions, Scope 1/2/3 Emissions
  - **Water:** Total Water, Potable Water, Reclaimed Water, Well Water
- **Portfolio**: Each portfolio presents data completeness (%) for each 12-month reporting period for each utility type and subtype aggregated across all properties.

<Note>
  Data Completeness = (Actual Days with Data / Expected Days with Data) × 100%
</Note>

### Meter-level Calculation

How data completeness (%) is calculated for an individual meter

**Example**: The electric meter pictured below has data for all months in a 12-month reporting period except July and August. The property is owned and the meter is active is over all 12-months.

![Group 1000002821](/images/Group1000002821.png)

- Expected days with data = 365
- Actual data with data = 303
- **Meter Data Completeness = 303 / 365 = 83%**

### Property-level Calculation

How data completeness (%) is calculated for at the property level

**Example**: A property has 4 energy meters (3 electric; 1 fuel). The property is owned and all meters are active over all 12-months of the reporting period.

Individual Meters

- Electric Meter 1: Data Completeness = [303 / 365] = 83%
- Electric Meter 2: Data Completeness = [306 / 365] = 84% _(Note: February has 28 days)_
- Electric Meter 3: Data Completeness = [365 / 365] = 100%
- Fuel Meter 1: Data Completeness = [184 / 365] = 50.4% _(Note: 6-month end gap)_

**Property Level**

- Total Electricty Data Completeness = [303 + 306 + 365] / [365\*4] = 89%
- Total Fuel Data Completeness = 184 / 365 = 50.4%
- **Total Energy Data Completeness = [303 + 306 + 365 + 184] / [365\*4] = 79.3%**
