Data completeness measures what percentage of expected meter readings you actually have for a reporting period. GRESB requires high data completeness (typically 80%+) for valid performance submissions.

## How It's Calculated

```
Data Completeness = (Actual Reading Days / Expected Reading Days) × 100%
```

For a 365-day reporting year with 350 days of readings: **96% complete**

## Completeness Thresholds

| Level | Percentage | GRESB Status |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Excellent** | 95%+ | Full inclusion |
| **Good** | 80-94% | Full inclusion |
| **Marginal** | 50-79% | May be flagged |
| **Poor** | Under 50% | Likely excluded |

<Warning>
**GRESB Threshold:** Properties below 80% data completeness may be excluded from performance scoring or flagged for data quality issues.
</Warning>

## Common Causes of Low Completeness

- Meter installation mid-year
- Utility billing gaps
- Failed API syncs from ESPM
- Properties sold/acquired mid-period
- Tenant-controlled meters with missing data

## Improving Completeness

    **Data Quality** → **Completeness** widget shows properties below threshold
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review meter-level detail">
    Click property → **Meters** → sort by "Completeness" column
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Collect missing data">
    Request bills from tenants or utilities for gap periods
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Apply gap-filling">
    For acceptable gaps, use estimation methods
  </Step>
