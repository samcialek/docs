Jumps are sudden, significant changes in consumption that deviate from normal patterns. They may indicate data entry errors, true operational changes, or billing adjustments that need review.

## Types of Jumps

| Type | Pattern | Likely Cause |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Spike** | 2-3x normal | True-up bill, data error, event |
| **Drop** | Near zero | Meter issue, vacancy, error |
| **Negative** | Below zero | True-up correction, entry error |
| **Sustained shift** | New baseline | Tenant change, equipment |

## Jump Detection in Abisko

Abisko flags readings that exceed typical variation thresholds:

- **Month-over-month:** Greater than 50% change
- **Year-over-year:** Greater than 30% change for same month
- **Statistical:** More than 2 standard deviations from mean

## Reviewing Jumps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Data Quality">
    **Data Quality** → **Jumps** tab
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review flagged readings">
    List shows meters with unusual variations
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Investigate">
    Compare to weather, occupancy, and operational changes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resolve or confirm">
    Correct errors or mark as verified if legitimate
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Resolutions

| Cause | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| **Data entry error** | Correct the value |
| **True-up bill** | Split across prior months |
| **Unit error** | Convert to correct units |
| **Real change** | Document and verify |

<Tip>
**Not All Jumps Are Errors:** Seasonal variations, tenant move-ins, and equipment changes can cause legitimate jumps. Investigate before correcting.
