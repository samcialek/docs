Abisko provides a number of comprehensive EXCEL data quality and performance reports that highlight gaps, overlaps, jumps, high & low values and completeness metrics across meters, properties and portfolios.

These reports can be generated on-demand for any reporting period and enable teams to conduct advanced analysis outside of the Abisko platform.
