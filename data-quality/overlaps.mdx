Overlaps occur when multiple readings exist for the same meter during the same time period. This inflates consumption totals and must be resolved before accurate reporting.

## Common Causes

| Cause | Example | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Duplicate imports** | Same bill imported twice | Delete duplicate |
| **Overlapping dates** | Jan 15-Feb 15 + Feb 1-Mar 1 | Adjust date ranges |
| **Meter replacement** | Old and new meter both active | Set deactivation date |
| **Manual + sync** | User entry + ESPM import | Remove duplicate |
