Data coverage measures what percentage of your building's gross floor area (GFA) has associated energy consumption data. GRESB uses this to assess whether your reported data represents the whole building or just a portion.

## How It's Calculated

```
Data Coverage = (Floor Area with Meter Data / Total GFA) × 100%
```

**Example:**
- Total GFA: 100,000 sq ft
- Base building (metered): 20,000 sq ft
- Tenant A (metered): 30,000 sq ft
- Tenant B (not metered): 25,000 sq ft
- Tenant C (metered): 25,000 sq ft

Coverage = (20k + 30k + 25k) / 100k = **75%**

## Coverage by Category

| Category | What's Included | GRESB Column |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Energy coverage** | Area served by electric/gas meters | Data coverage % |
| **Water coverage** | Area served by water meters | Separate column |
| **Landlord coverage** | Landlord-controlled area with data | Subset of total |
| **Tenant coverage** | Tenant-controlled area with data | Subset of total |

<Warning>
**Low Coverage Impact:** Properties with less than 50% coverage may be excluded from certain GRESB calculations or flagged for data quality issues.
</Warning>

## Improving Coverage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify gaps">
    **Dashboard** → **Data Coverage** widget shows properties below target
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review unmetered areas">
    Click property → See which spaces lack meter assignments
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Collect tenant data">
    Request utility data from tenants in unmetered spaces
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Apply estimation if needed">
    For truly unavailable data, document estimation methodology
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Quick Win:** Adding tenant-obtained data to supplemental meters increases coverage even if you can't control the data quality.
