Data coverage (%) is a spatial metric that refers to the amount of floor area within a property or space for which utility data is available and being tracked. It is critical for properly understanding and reporting building performance and is required by many reporting frameworks, such as GRESB.

<Note>
  Taken together, data completeness and coverage metrics allow users to understand how complete and representative the data underlying a performance metric is.
</Note>

## Data Coverage Areas

Data coverage is separately tracked and reported for each combination of utility and space type.  Abisko uniquely enables simultaneously tracking of whole building and space-based data coverages for each utility type.

| **Whole Building** | **Landlord -Common Areas** | **Landlord -Shared Services** | **Tenant Spaces -Landlord Controlled** | **Tenant Spaces -Tenant Controlled** |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| _Electricity_      | _Electricity_              | _Electricity_                 | _Electricity_                          | _Electricity_                        |
| _Fuel_             | _Fuel_                     | _Fuel_                        | _Fuel_                                 | _Fuel_                               |
| _DHC_              | _DHC_                      | _DHC_                         | _DHC_                                  | _DHC_                                |
| _Water_            | _Water_                    | _Water_                       | _Water_                                | _Water_                              |

## How It's Calculated

To calculate the data coverage for a floor area, two values are required for each combination of utility and space type:

- **Floor Area Covered**: The floor area corresponding to tracked utility consumption.
  - If consumption data is unavailable for a space type, the **Floor Area Covered** = 0.
- **Maximum Floor Area**: The total floor area serviced by a utility type.
  - If a space type is not serviced by a utility type, the data coverage is not applicable.

<Check>
  **Data Coverage = Floor Area Covered / Maximum Floor Area**
</Check>

If data coverage = 100% across all utility types for a space type, that means that all performance metrics reported for that space type wholly represent the total area of that space type.

### Example: Whole Building

<Note>
  Whole Building data coverage by definition applies to the consumption from all in-metric meters, which contribute to whole building performance metrics. [Click here to learn more.](/properties-meters/meters/meter-status#whole-building-metrics)
</Note>

| Whole Building             | Floor Area Covered        | Max Floor Area            | Data Coverage |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| Electricity                | 20,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 20,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 100%          |
| Fuel                       | 15,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 15,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 100%          |
| District Heating & Cooling | N/A                       | N/A                       | N/A           |
| **TOTAL ENERGY**           | **35,000 ft<sup>2</sup>** | **35,000 ft<sup>2</sup>** | **100%**      |

- The whole building data coverage is 100% for every utility type that the property is serviced by. That means that reported whole building total energy, electricity and fuel performance metrics wholly represent all utility data associated with the property.
- This property also is not serviced by any District Heating & Cooling and so these values do not contribute to data coverage calculations.

### Example: Landlord Common Areas

<Note>
  Space-based data coverage applies to the consumption of all meters (in-metric and out-of-metric) that are assigned to a space type. [Click here to learn more.](/properties-meters/meters/meter-space-assignments#assigning-meters-to-spaces)
</Note>

| Landlord - Common Areas    | Floor Area Covered        | Max Floor Area            | Data Coverage |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------ | :------------ |
| Electricity                | 10,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 20,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 50%           |
| Fuel                       | 15,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 15,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 100%          |
| District Heating & Cooling | N/A                       | N/A                       | N/A           |
| **TOTAL ENERGY**           | **25,000 ft<sup>2</sup>** | **35,000 ft<sup>2</sup>** | **71.4%**     |

- The landlord common areas total energy data coverage is 71.4%. This is because the electricity data coverage is only 50%, possibly due to missing submeter data. In this case, common area fuel performance metrics represent all data but electricity metrics only partially represent the total common area performance.
- This property also is not serviced by any District Heating & Cooling and so these values do not contribute to data coverage calculations.

## How It's Tracked

Data coverages in Abisko use a **"current as of"** methodology. This means Abisko always reports the data coverage values from the most recent date _prior to the end_ of your selected reporting period.

<Note>
  **Key Principle:** Abisko finds the data coverage entry with the most recent date that falls before or on December 31 of your reporting year, then uses those values.
</Note>

**Example:** For GRESB 2024 reporting, if you have data coverages dated:

- 1/1/2023
- 6/1/2023
- 12/31/2023
- 3/1/2024

Abisko reports the **12/31/2023** values — the most recent date before the end of CY 2023.

---

## Locking In Values

If you want to guarantee specific coverage values for a reporting year, set the date to **December 31** of that year.

| Coverage Date | Used For            |
| :------------ | :------------------ |
| 12/31/2022    | 2022 reporting year |
| 12/31/2023    | 2023 reporting year |
| 12/31/2024    | 2024 reporting year |

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** Since no later date can exist within that calendar year, a 12/31 entry will always be the one reported for that year.
</Tip>

---

## Values Persist Forward

Data coverages carry forward automatically. You don't need to create new entries every year if nothing changes.

**Example:** If you only have two entries:

- 1/1/1900 (legacy default)
- 1/1/2023 (your actual coverage)

Then **both 2023 and 2024** reporting years will use the 1/1/2023 values — it's the most recent date prior to the end of each period.

<Tip>
  If you prefer explicit year-by-year records, you can always click **"Add New"** and save copied values with an updated date. This is optional but can help with audit trails.
</Tip>
