Data coverage (%) is a spatial metric that refers to the amount of floor area within a property or space for which utility data is available and being tracked. It is critical for properly understanding and reporting building performance and is required by many reporting frameworks, such as GRESB.

<Note>
  Taken together, data completeness and coverage metrics allow users to understand how complete and representative the data underlying a performance metric is.
</Note>

## Data Coverage Areas

Data coverage is separately tracked and reported for each combination of utility and space type.  Abisko uniquely enables simultaneously tracking of whole building and space-based data coverages for each utility type.

| **Whole Building** | **Landlord -Common Areas** | **Landlord -Shared Services** | **Tenant Spaces -Landlord Controlled** | **Tenant Spaces -Tenant Controlled** |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| _Electricity_      | _Electricity_              | _Electricity_                 | _Electricity_                          | _Electricity_                        |
| _Fuel_             | _Fuel_                     | _Fuel_                        | _Fuel_                                 | _Fuel_                               |

## How It's Calculated

To calculate the data coverage for a floor area, two values are required for each combination of utility and space type:

- **Floor Area Covered**: The floor area corresponding to tracked utility consumption.
  - If consumption data is unavailable for a space type, the **Floor Area Covered** = 0.
- **Maximum Floor Area**: The total floor area serviced by a utility type.
  - If a space type is not serviced by a utility type, the data coverage is not applicable.

<Check>
  **Data Coverage = Floor Area Covered / Maximum Floor Area**
</Check>

If data coverage = 100% across all utility types for a space type, that means that all performance metrics reported for that space type wholly represent the total area of that space type.

### Example: Whole Building

<Note>
  Whole Building data coverage by definition applies to the consumption from all in-metric meters, which contribute to whole building performance metrics. [Click here to learn more.](/properties-meters/meters/meter-status#whole-building-metrics)
</Note>

| Whole Building             | Floor Area Covered        | Max Floor Area            | Data Coverage |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| Electricity                | 20,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 20,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 100%          |
| Fuel                       | 15,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 15,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 100%          |
| District Heating & Cooling | N/A                       | N/A                       | N/A           |
| **TOTAL ENERGY**           | **<sup>35,000 ft2</sup>** | **<sup>35,000 ft2</sup>** | **100%**      |

- The whole building data coverage is 100% for every utility type that the property is serviced by. That means that reported whole building total energy, electricity and fuel performance metrics wholly represent all utility data associated with the property.
- This property also is not serviced by any District Heating & Cooling and so these values do not contribute to data coverage calculations.

### Example: Landlord Common Areas

<Note>
  Space-based data coverage applies to the consumption of all meters (in-metric and out-of-metric) that are assigned to a space type. [Click here to learn more.](/properties-meters/meters/meter-space-assignments#assigning-meters-to-spaces)
</Note>

| Landlord - Common Areas    | Floor Area Covered        | Max Floor Area            | Data Coverage |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------ | :------------ |
| Electricity                | 10,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 20,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 50%           |
| Fuel                       | 0 ft<sup>2</sup>          | 15,000 ft<sup>2</sup>     | 0%            |
| District Heating & Cooling | N/A                       | N/A                       | N/A           |
| **TOTAL ENERGY**           | **<sup>10,000 ft2</sup>** | **<sup>35,000 ft2</sup>** | **28.6%**     |

- The total common areas energy data coverage is 28.6%. This is because the electricity data coverage is only 50%, possibly due to missing submeter data, and fuel data coverage is 0% because there is no fuel data available for the space type.
- All common area performance metrics only partially represent the energy use of the space.

## Tracking & Reporting Data Coverage

### Data Coverage Persistence

Data coverages in Abisko are set by using a "current as of" methodology. This means Abisko always reports the data coverage values from the most recent date _prior to the end_ of the selected reporting period, letting users avoid the need to create new entries every year if nothing changes.

**Example: There are two whole building data coverage entries with the following dates**

- 1/1/1900 (default)
  - For any reporting period before 1/1/2023 (e.g. 6/30/2021, 12/31/2022), Abisko will report the whole building data coverages associated with the default date (1/1/1900)
- 1/1/2023 (user set)
  - For any reporting period after 1/1/2023 (e.g. 12/31/2023, 6/30/2025), Abisko will report the whole building data coverages associated with the user set date (1/1/2023)

To guarantee specific coverage values for a reporting year, users can set the data coverage date to **December 31** of that year.

<Note>
  Whole building and space-based data coverages are tracked independently and therefore can have different dates associated with them. Reported data coverage values therefore depend both on the reporting period and the metric (whole building or space-based) that is reported.
