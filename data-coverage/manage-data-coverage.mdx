Whole building and space-based data coverages are tracked independently and can have different dates associated with them. Users can add, edit and delete data coverages separately for whole building and space consumption.

To edit data coverage values, users must first access the appropriate **Whole Building** or **Space-based** data coverage sidebar as described [here](index).

## Data Coverage Validations

Data coverages can be complex to track and report propertly. Abisko has integrated data validations to guide users to enter compliant values.
