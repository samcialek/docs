Abisko enables concurrent tracking of **whole building** and **space-based** data coverages. This allows users to fully understand utility data coverage in the context of the whole building as well as across landlord and tenant spaces, which is extremely useful for mixed-use properties.

The following section provides examples of properties with different meter configurations and how those configurations affect data coverage. It is intended as a reference for users managing more complex meter setups.

### Example 1

<Note>
  This scenario is common for retail properties with limited submetering.
</Note>

- The property has a mix of landlord and tenant spaces
- A property has a total of 3 submeters for which data is tracked (no aggregate meters)
  - All meters are **in-metric** and therefore contribute to whole building metrics
  - No tenant data is available and therefore no meters are assigned to tenant spaces
  - All 3 submeters and are assigned to **Base Building - Common Areas**

In the above configuration, certain performance metrics (e.g. Total Energy) will be equal for **whole building** and **base building - common areas**, because they are driven by the same meters. However, data coverages will differ because the **whole building** includes tenant spaces, for which **actual covered area** is 0.

- **Total energy whole building data coverage = 33%**

  <Note>
    If only submeters are available, whole building data coverage should be equal to the sum of all landlord and tenant space coverages because they are based on the same meters.
  </Note>
- **Total energy tenant spaces data coverage = 0%**
- **Total energy common areas data coverage = 100%**

### Example 2

<Note>
  This scenario is common for properties with aggregate whole building meters and some submeters. Users can report whole building data with 100% coverage and track partial coverages as additional tenant and common area submeters are brought online.
</Note>

- The property has a mix of landlord and tenant spaces
- A property has a total of 7 submeters for which data is tracked
  - 2 aggregate meters are **in-metric** and therefore contribute to whole building metrics
  - 3 **out-of-metric** meters are assigned to **Tenant Spaces**
  - 2 **out-of-metric** meters are assigned to **Common Areas**

![Group 1000002827](/images/Group1000002827.png)

In the above configuration, performance metrics will always differ for **whole building, tenant spaces, and common areas**. This is because the **whole building** metrics are driven by aggregate **in-metric** meters and the space-based metrics are driven be a completely different set of **out-of-metric** meters.

- **Total energy whole building data coverage = 100%**
  - The **in-metric **aggregate meters reflect total whole building consumption for both electricity and fuel

    <Note>
      Aggregate whole building meters always represent 100% coverage for the utility type.
    </Note>
- **Total energy tenant spaces data coverage = 66%**
  - Tenant spaces are not serviced by fuel or DHC
  - 4,000 ft<sup>2</sup> of the 6,000 ft<sup>2</sup> of tenant spaces serviced by electricity have data available from the **out-of-metric** submeters
- **Total energy common areas data coverage = 100%**
  - Common Areas are serviced by both electricity and fuel **out-of-metric** meters
  - 4,000 ft<sup>2</sup> of the 4,000 ft<sup>2</sup> of common areas serviced by electricity and fuel have data available from the assigned **out-of-metric** submeters
