Abisko enables concurrent tracking of **whole building** and **space-based** data coverages. This allows users to fully understand utility data coverage in the context of the whole building as well as across landlord and tenant spaces, which is extremely useful for mixed-use properties.

The following section provides examples of properties with different meter configurations and how those configurations affect data coverage. It is intended as a reference for users managing more complex meter setups.

### Example 1

<Note>
  This is a common scenarios in retail properties
</Note>

- The property has a mix of landlord and tenant spaces
- A property has a total of 3 submeters for which data is tracked (no aggregate meters)
  - All meters are **in-metric** and therefore contribute to whole building metrics
  - No tenant data is available and therefore no meters are assigned to tenant spaces
  - All 3 submeters and are assigned to **Base Building - Common Areas**

In the above configuration, certain performance metrics (e.g. Total Energy) will be equal for **whole building** and **base building - common areas**, because they are driven by the same meters. However, data coverages will significantly differ because the **whole building** includes tenant spaces, for which **actual covered area** is 0.

- **Total energy whole building data coverage = 33%**

  <Note>
    If only submeters are available, whole building data coverage should be equal to the sum of all landlord and tenant space coverages because they are based on the same meters.
  </Note>
- **Total energy common areas data coverage = 100%**
- **Total energy tenant spaces data coverage = 0%**
