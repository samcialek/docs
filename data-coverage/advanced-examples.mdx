Abisko enables users to track **whole building** and **space-based** data coverage concurrently. This allows users to fully understand utility data coverage in the context of the whole building as well as across landlord and tenant spaces. 

The following section provides examples of properties with different meter configurations that impact data coverages. It is meant to serve as a reference for users with more complex meter configurations (e.g. multi-tenant properties)

### Example 1

- The property has a mix of landlord and tenant spaces
- A property has 3 meters that are being tracked
  - All meters are **in-metric** and contribute to whole building performance metrics
