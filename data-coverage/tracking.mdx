## Data Coverage Dates

### Forward Persistence

Data coverages in Abisko are set by using a **current as of** methodology. This means Abisko always reports the data coverage values from the most recent date _prior to the end_ of the selected reporting period, removing the need to create new entries every year if nothing changes.

**Example: There are two whole building data coverage entries with the following dates**

- 1/1/1900 (default) & 1/1/2023 (user set)
- For any reporting period before 1/1/2023 (e.g. 6/30/2021, 12/31/2022)
  - Whole building data coverages associated with the default date (1/1/1900) are reported
- For any reporting period after 1/1/2023 (e.g. 12/31/2023, 6/30/2025)
  - Whole building data coverages associated with the user set date (1/1/2023) are reported

<Tip>
  To guarantee specific coverage values for a reporting year, users can set the data coverage date to **December 31** of that year.

## Tracking Data Coverage Values

Whole building and space-based data coverages are tracked independently and can have different dates associated with them. Reported data coverage values thus depend both on the reporting period and the space type for which performance is being reported.

### Whole Building Data Coverages

Whole building data coverage can be accessed at both the property and portfolio levels.

**Property Level**

- **Navigate to Property → Meters**
  - Click on the **Data Coverage - Whole Building** button at the top-right
  - The sidebar will open to the data coverage values associated with most recent date _prior to the end_ of the selected reporting period

**Portfolio Level**

- **Navigate to Portfolio → Property Trends**
  - Click on the **Data Coverage** toggle in the top-right plot to view the distribution of data coverages for all properties for the selected reporting period.
  - Click on the **Data Coverage** progress bar of any property to open a sidebar to view the property's **whole building data coverage** for the selected reporting period
