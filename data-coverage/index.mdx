Data coverage (%) is a spatial metric that refers to the amount of floor area within a property or space for which utility data is available and being tracked. It is critical for properly understanding and reporting building performance and is required by many reporting frameworks, such as GRESB.

<Note>
  Taken together, data completeness and coverage metrics allow users to understand how complete and representative the data underlying a performance metric is.

## Data Coverage - Utility & Space Types

Data coverage is separately tracked and reported for each combination of utility and space type.  Abisko uniquely enables concurrent tracking of whole building and space-based data coverages for each utility type.

**The below displays each of the utility and space types for which data coverage can be tracked.**

| **Whole Building** | **Base Building -Common Areas** | **Base Building -Shared Services** | **Tenant Spaces -Landlord Controlled** | **Tenant Spaces -Tenant Controlled** |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| _Electricity_      | _Electricity_                   | _Electricity_                      | _Electricity_                          | _Electricity_                        |
| _Fuel_             | _Fuel_                          | _Fuel_                             | _Fuel_                                 | _Fuel_                               |
| _DHC_              | _DHC_                           | _DHC_                              | _DHC_                                  | _DHC_                                |
| _Water_            | _Water_                         | _Water_                            | _Water_                                | _Water_                              |

## How It's Calculated

To calculate the data coverage for a floor area, two values are required for each combination of utility and space type:

- **Floor Area Covered**: The floor area corresponding to tracked utility consumption data.
  - If consumption data is unavailable for a space type, the **Floor Area Covered** = 0.
- **Max Area Covered**: The total floor area serviced by a utility type.
  - If a space type is not serviced by a utility type, the data coverage is not applicable.

<Check>
  ****Data Coverage = [Floor Area Covered ÷ Max Area Covered]****
</Check>

If data coverage = 100% across all utility types for a space type, that means that all performance metrics reported for that space type wholly represent the total area of that space type.

### Example: Whole Building

<Note>
  Whole Building data coverage by definition applies to the consumption from all in-metric meters, which contribute to whole building performance metrics. [Click here to learn more.](/properties-meters/meters/meter-status#whole-building-metrics)
</Note>

The table below presents **whole building data coverage** values for each utility type.

| Utility Type               | Floor Area Covered    | Max Area Covered      | Data Coverage |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| Electricity                | 20,000 ft<sup>2</sup> | 20,000 ft<sup>2</sup> | 100%          |
| Fuel                       | 15,000 ft<sup>2</sup> | 15,000 ft<sup>2</sup> | 100%          |
| District Heating & Cooling | N/A                   | N/A                   | Not Serviced  |
| **TOTAL ENERGY**           | 35,000 ft<sup>2</sup> | 35,000 ft<sup>2</sup> | 100%          |

- The whole building data coverage is 100% for each utility type that the property is serviced by.
- The whole building total energy data coverage is also 100%, calculated by dividing the sum of all floor area covered values by the sum of all max area covered values.
- This property is not serviced by any District Heating & Cooling.

### Example: Landlord Common Areas

<Note>
  Space-based data coverage applies to the consumption of all meters (in-metric and out-of-metric) that are assigned to a space type. [Click here to learn more.](/properties-meters/meters/meter-space-assignments#assigning-meters-to-spaces)
</Note>

The table below presents **base building - common areas** data coverage values for each utility type.

| Base Building - Common Areas | Floor Area Covered     | Max Area Covered       | Data Coverage |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------ |
| Electricity                  | 10,000 ft<sup>2</sup>  | 20,000 ft<sup>2</sup>  | 50%           |
| Fuel                         | 0 ft<sup>2</sup>       | 15,000 ft<sup>2</sup>  | 0%            |
| District Heating & Cooling   | N/A                    | N/A                    | N/A           |
| **TOTAL ENERGY**             | 10,000  ft<sup>2</sup> | 35,000  ft<sup>2</sup> | 28.6%         |

- The base building - common areas data coverage for electricity is 50%.
  - This is possibly due to missing submeter data.
- The base building - common areas data coverage for fuel is 0%.
  - There is no fuel data available for this space type, even though it is serviced by fuel meters.
- The total common areas energy data coverage is 28.6%, calculated by dividing the sum of all floor area covered values by the sum of all max floor area values.
- All common area performance metrics only partially represent the energy use of the space.
