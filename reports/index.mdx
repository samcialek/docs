The first three reports in the toolkit will include the following: 

1)	Energy & Emissions (Spaces) Audit: A comprehensive EXCEL workbook with monthly & annual meter, property, and portfolio-level breakdowns of energy consumption and emissions by landlord, tenant, and other space types. Monthly reference emissions factors for each meter enable comprehensive auditing of energy & emissions data and data quality checks provide data completeness metrics and identify meter-level gaps, overlaps, monthly jumps, data coverage events and more. This report leverages all ESPM in-metric and out-of-metric meters that are assigned to space types in Abisko.

Loved by data analysts who want all the performance details to work their excel magic.

2)	Water (Spaces) Audit:  A comprehensive EXCEL workbook with monthly & annual meter, property, and portfolio-level breakdowns of water consumption by landlord, tenant, and other space types. Data quality checks provide data completeness metrics and identify meter-level gaps, overlaps, monthly jumps, data coverage events and more. This report leverages all ESPM in-metric and out-of-metric meters that are assigned to space types in Abisko.

A complement to the Energy & Emissions Audit for comprehensive water data analysis.

3)	GRESB Asset Spreadsheet: A submission-ready GRESB Asset Spreadsheet with GRESB-approved options for gap-filling and complex calculations for data availability, green power, market-based emissions, waste disposal allocations, tenant vs. landlord breakdowns and more.

The final step of transforming and formatting ESPM data for GRESB reporting.
