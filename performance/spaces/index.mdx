Space-level analysis breaks down building consumption by who controls and pays for energy. This is essential for accurate GRESB scope reporting.

## Why Space Analysis Matters

GRESB requires consumption reported by control type:

| Control | Typical Areas | GRESB Scope |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Landlord | Base building, common areas | Scope 1 & 2 |
| Tenant | Leased spaces | Scope 3 |

Without space-level analysis, you can only report whole-building totals—missing the granular splits investors expect.
