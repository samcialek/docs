Location-based and market-based are two methods for calculating Scope 2 (purchased electricity) emissions. GRESB requires reporting both.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM uses only location-based grid factors. Abisko calculates both methods and incorporates your renewable energy contracts and RECs into market-based calculations.
</Note>

## The Two Methods

| Method | What It Uses | Best For |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Location-Based** | Regional grid average emissions factor | Baseline comparison, policy compliance |
| **Market-Based** | Contractual instruments (RECs, PPAs, green tariffs) | Showing renewable procurement impact |

## How They Differ in Practice

<Tip>
**Same building, different results:**

A building uses 1,000 MWh electricity in Texas (ERCOT grid).

- **Location-based:** 1,000 MWh × 0.4 kg CO2e/kWh = **400 tonnes CO2e**
- **Market-based (with 100% wind RECs):** 1,000 MWh × 0.0 kg CO2e/kWh = **0 tonnes CO2e**
</Tip>

## Which Instruments Qualify for Market-Based

| Instrument | Qualifies? | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| Bundled RECs from on-site solar | ✅ Yes | Must retain environmental attributes |
| Unbundled RECs (purchased separately) | ✅ Yes | Must match reporting year |
| Green utility tariff | ✅ Yes | Contractual documentation required |
| Carbon offsets | ❌ No | Offsets are separate from Scope 2 |

## Configuring in Abisko

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set location-based defaults">
    Abisko auto-assigns eGRID factors based on property location
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add renewable contracts">
    **Property** → **Green Power** → Enter REC or PPA details
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review both calculations">
    Dashboard shows location and market-based emissions side by side
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Export for GRESB">
    Asset spreadsheet includes both columns as required
  </Step>
</Steps>
