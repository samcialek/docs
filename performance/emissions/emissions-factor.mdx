An emissions factor is a coefficient that converts energy consumption (kWh, therms, gallons) into carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO2e). Different fuels and electricity grids have different emissions factors.

<Note>
  **How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM applies a single national grid factor. Abisko uses regional eGRID subregion factors for location-based calculations and incorporates your specific utility and renewable contracts for market-based calculations.

## Common Emissions Factors

| Fuel Type            | Typical Factor | Units          | Notes                     |
| -------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Natural Gas          | 5.3            | kg CO2e/therm  | Combustion only (Scope 1) |
| Electricity (US avg) | 0.4            | kg CO2e/kWh    | Varies by grid region     |
| Diesel               | 10.2           | kg CO2e/gallon | Generators, vehicles      |
| Propane              | 5.7            | kg CO2e/gallon | Heating, backup           |

## Grid Electricity Varies by Region

<Tip>
  **Example:** The same 1,000 MWh of electricity produces vastly different emissions:

  - **CAMX (California):** 0.23 kg/kWh → 230 tonnes CO2e
  - **RFCW (Midwest):** 0.47 kg/kWh → 470 tonnes CO2e
  - **NWPP (Pacific NW):** 0.28 kg/kWh → 280 tonnes CO2e
</Tip>

## Location vs Market-Based Factors

In addition to all EGRID emissions factors for calculating location- based emissions, Abisko has all the local emissions factors for each supported BPS and CRREM already in the system. This is so you can analyze your exposure and plot your decarb pathways directly within the context that you need. However, we don't currently let users directly (we can technically do it in the backend) input their own custom factors for market-based emissions. It is important to note that Abisko does adhere strictly with the GHG protocol for how to handle RECs (owned, sold, arbitraged, exported) when calculating onsite and offsite green-power and related location/market-based emissions. Abisko is the only platform that adheres fully to it as I describe in the proposal in more detail, but for grid offsite non-renewable energy (i.e. non-RECs), we will only enable custom emissions in 2026. We wanted to focus on getting the hard part, the RECs management, right first.

| Method             | Factor Source                     | When It Changes             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Location-based** | EPA eGRID regional average        | Updated annually by EPA     |
| **Market-based**   | Supplier-specific or residual mix | Based on contracts and RECs |

## CRREM Emissions Factorsd

Currently, we also have 'projected grid emissions factors' in the 'CRREM / Emissions' tab (and 'Compliance / LL97'), which you can also leverage the ECM scenario analysis

## How Abisko Applies Factors

<Steps>
  <Step title="Auto-assign by location">
    Property ZIP code determines eGRID subregion for location-based
  </Step>
  <Step title="Override if needed">
    For international properties or specific supplier data, enter custom factors
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply fuel-specific factors">
    Each meter type (gas, electric, steam) uses appropriate conversion
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calculate both methods">
    Dashboard shows location and market-based totals using respective factors
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Annual Updates:** eGRID factors update each year. Abisko incorporates new factors when EPA releases them, which may change year-over-year comparisons even for the same consumption.
</Warning>
