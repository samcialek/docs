## GHG Protocol Alignment

Market-based emissions are calculated in accordance with the **GHG Protocol** and appropriately reflect the impacts of onsite and offsite green power based on renewable energy certificate (REC) ownership.

## Emissions Factors

Market-based emissions calculations leverage the same underlying emissions factors that are used for location-based emissions.

<Note>
  Abisko applies the same emissions factors used by ESPM. Sources: [**ESPM**](https://energystar.my.site.com/PortfolioManager/s/article/What-Emissions-Factors-used-to-calculate-my-Emissions-1748914027605), [**EPA**](https://www.epa.gov/egrid/detailed-data)
</Note>

For select municipal markets, locally published emissions factors developed specifically for Building Performance Standards (BPS) are available to support more detailed **market-based emissions** analysis. These local market-based factors supplement national or eGRID-based factors and are currently available for New York City, Boston, and Seattle.

## Green Power

Unlike location-based calculations, market-based emissions account for zero-emissions electricity from both onsite and offsite green power sources. To reflect these sources, a property’s total electricity consumption is adjusted prior to calculating market-based emissions.

### Green Power Adjustments

- **Total Electricity**: Energy consumption associated with all onsite and grid electric meters, regardless of REC ownership status.
- **Total Onsite Green Power**: Electricity generated and used onsite for which RECs are owned.
- **Total Offsite Green Power**: The sum of all purchased and exported electricity and electricity generated onsite for which RECs are arbitraged.

<Check>
  **Adjusted Electricity**: [Total Electricity] - [Total Onsite Green Power] - [Total Offsite Green Power]
</Check>

The adjusted electricity value represents the net amount of grid electricity for which emissions are calculated. Convesely, onsite and offsite green power do not contribute to market-based emissions.

## Performance Metrics

The following market-based emissions metrics are automatically calculated any time data is updated for any applicable energy meter.

| Metric                                | Definition                                                                                                 |
| :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total (Market-based) Emissions**    | _The sum of direct and indirect market-based emissions_                                                    |
| **Total (Market-based) Intensity**    | _Total Emissions / Gross Floor Area_                                                                       |
| **Indirect (Market-based) Emissions** | _Emissions from electricity and district energy sources accounting for all onsite and offsite green power_ |
| **Direct Emissions**                  | _Emissions from fuels and energy sources burned onsite_                                                    |

### Methodology

<Steps>
  <Step title="All energy meters associated with a space type are collected">
    - For whole building performance metrics all **in-metric** meters are used.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meter consumption is normalized into common units & calendar months">
    Consumption entries between meter activation & deactivation dates and property buy and sell dates are broken down and reconstituted into monthly values for each meter. Data outside of these boundaries is ignored.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly emissions values are calculated for each meter">
    1. Emissions factors are determined by the energy meter subtype and property location
    2. Monthly energy values are multiplied by the appropriate emissions factor

    <Note>
      Monthly electricity consumption totals for onsite renewable meters are adjusted by subtracting **Green Power – Onsite** values, which represent zero-emission electricity for which the associated RECs are owned.
    </Note>
    <Warning>
      Onsite generated electricity that is used and for which the associated RECs are sold or abritraged is treated as regular grid electricity when calculated **location-based emissions**, in accordance with GHG Protocol guidance. The same applies to electricity exported to the grid.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly emissions values are aggregated by type.">
    Meter-level emissions values are aggregated by type to enable direct, indirect and total location-based monthly emissions values.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly emissions values are aggregated over rolling 12-month periods">
    Monthly values are rolled up to provide annual location-based emissions metrics for every possible 12-month reporting period.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Values are further rolled up into portfolio-level insights.">
    Monthly and annual emissions values are aggregated across all properties to enable portfolio-level views.
  </Step>
</Steps>
