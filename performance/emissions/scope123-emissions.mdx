## Performance Hierarchy

```
Portfolio Level
├── Property Level (whole building)
│   ├── Landlord Consumption
│   │   ├── Scope 1 (on-site combustion)
│   │   └── Scope 2 (purchased electricity)
│   └── Tenant Consumption
│       └── Scope 3 (downstream leased)
```

Abisko calculates performance at each level, enabling both whole-building benchmarking and GRESB-required landlord/tenant splits.

- Green power adjustments for generated, used and exported on-site renewable are applied to total energy values following GHG Protocol methods (see diagram below):
  - **If RECs are owned:** Green power deducted from total values used in location and market-based emissions calculations
  - **If RECs are arbitraged:** Green power counted towards offsite green power used in market-based (only) emissions adjustments
  - **If RECs are sold:** No adjustment
- Offsite green power values where RECs are owned are normalized.
  - **Offsite Green Power Purchases **→ Offsite Green Power (GHG Protocol)
  - **Onsite Exported **→ Counted as Offsite Green Power (GHG Protocol)
  - **Onsite Arbitraged **→ Counted as Offsite Green Power (GHG Protocol)

3. Emissions scope and type is determined based on meter & space assignments.

- **Base Building [Fuel]** → Scope 1
  - **Whole Building [Fuel]** → Scope 1, Direct
  - **Base Building [Electricity, Fuel]** → Scope 2
  - **Whole Building [Electricity, Fuel]** → Scope 2, Indirect
  - **Tenant Spaces [All]** → Scope 3

4. Emissions factors are retrieved by subtype and month.

- **EGRID, Province (Canada), Country**
  - **Sourced from EPA and GHG Protocol**

5. Location-based emissions are calculated for every meter and month

6. Market-based emissions are calculated for every meter and month

- Offsite green power values are used to adjust total indirect emissions

7. Meter, property, and portfolio emissions are aggregated and reported.
