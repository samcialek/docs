## Performance Hierarchy

```
Portfolio Level
├── Property Level (whole building)
│   ├── Landlord Consumption
│   │   ├── Scope 1 (on-site combustion)
│   │   └── Scope 2 (purchased electricity)
│   └── Tenant Consumption
│       └── Scope 3 (downstream leased)
```

Abisko calculates performance at each level, enabling both whole-building benchmarking and GRESB-required landlord/tenant splits.
