Emissions tracking converts energy consumption into carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) for climate reporting. Abisko calculates emissions by scope, using both location-based and market-based methodologies.

## Emissions Calculation Flow

```
Consumption (kWh, therms) 
    × Emissions Factor (kgCO2e/unit)
    = Emissions (kgCO2e or tonnes)
```

Abisko applies appropriate factors based on fuel type, location, and any renewable energy contracts you've recorded.
