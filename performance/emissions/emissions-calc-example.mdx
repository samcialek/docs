## Methodology: Annual Energy & Emissions Calculations

 

The following document demonstrates how annual energy consumption and emissions totals are calculated and reported based on the property’s energy meter data. Let us examine a sample property with the following six (6) energy meters:

 

| Meter ID  | Type                            | In-Metric |
| :-------- | :------------------------------ | :-------- |
| 144555485 | Energy – Diesel                 | No        |
| 138823275 | Energy - District Chilled Water | Yes       |
| 137432270 | Energy – Electric               | Yes       |
| 144707760 | Energy – Electric               | Yes       |
| 150514953 | Energy - Electric On-Site Solar | Yes       |
| 137432268 | Energy - Natural Gas            | No        |

 Two (2) meters are ‘Not Used in Metrics’ and are excluded in annual energy and emissions calculations. The remaining meters are assigned to specific property space types (e.g. Base Building, Tenant Spaces).

 

| Meter ID  | Energy Type                | Space Assignment                             |
| :-------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| 138823275 | DHC                        | Exterior Areas / Parking - Tenant Controlled |
| 137432270 | Electricity                | Common Areas                                 |
| 144707760 | Electricity                | Tenant Spaces - Landlord Controlled          |
| 150514953 | Electricity: On-Site Solar | Shared Services                              |

 

These assignments determine the columns in the GRESB Asset Level Spreadsheet to which the energy consumption associated with each meter are applied. They also determine whether the emissions associated with each meter are characterized as Scope 1,2,3 according to the table below.

 

| **Energy type** | **Floor Area type**                            | **GHG Scope** |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| Fuel            | Whole Building - Landlord Controlled           | Scope 3       |
| DH&C            | Whole Building - Landlord Controlled           | Scope 3       |
| Electricity     | Whole Building - Landlord Controlled           | Scope 3       |
| Fuel            | Whole Building - Tenant Controlled             | Scope 3       |
| DH&C            | Whole Building - Tenant Controlled             | Scope 3       |
| Electricity     | Whole Building - Tenant Controlled             | Scope 3       |
| Fuel            | Shared Services                                | Scope 1       |
| DH&C            | Shared Services                                | Scope 2       |
| Electricity     | Shared Services                                | Scope 2       |
| Fuel            | Common Areas                                   | Scope 1       |
| DH&C            | Common Areas                                   | Scope 2       |
| Electricity     | Common Areas                                   | Scope 2       |
| Fuel            | Tenant Spaces - Landlord Controlled            | Scope 3       |
| DH&C            | Tenant Spaces - Landlord Controlled            | Scope 3       |
| Electricity     | Tenant Spaces - Landlord Controlled            | Scope 3       |
| Fuel            | Tenant Spaces - Tenant Controlled              | Scope 3       |
| DH&C            | Tenant Spaces - Tenant Controlled              | Scope 3       |
| Electricity     | Tenant Spaces - Tenant Controlled              | Scope 3       |
| Electricity     | Exterior Areas / Parking - Landlord Controlled | Scope 2       |
| Fuel            | Exterior Areas / Parking - Landlord Controlled | Scope 1       |
| Electricity     | Exterior Areas / Parking - Tenant Controlled   | Scope 3       |
| Fuel            | Exterior Areas / Parking - Tenant Controlled   | Scope 3       |

 

With this information we know the Scope of emissions for each of our meters.

 

| Meter ID  | Energy Type                | Scope   |
| :-------- | :------------------------- | :------ |
| 138823275 | DHC                        | Scope 3 |
| 137432270 | Electricity                | Scope 2 |
| 144707760 | Electricity                | Scope 3 |
| 150514953 | Electricity: On-Site Solar | Scope 2 |

 

Now, we must determine the annual energy associated with each meter, while considering several parameters that impact the period of time used in the calculation.

 

-        Meter Activation Date: Data associated with any time before a meter activation date is ignored

-        Meter Deactivation Date: Data associated with any time after a meter deactivation date is ignored

-        Property Date Bought: Data associated with any time before a property date bought is ignored

-        Property Date Sold: Data associated with any time after a property date sold is ignored

 

Let’s take a look at these parameters for our property and meters.

 

| Property Date Bought | 5/1/19   |
| :------------------- | :------- |
| Property Date Sold   | 11/15/22 |

 

| Meter     | Activation Date | Deactivation Date |
| :-------- | :-------------- | :---------------- |
| 138823275 | 1/1/20          | 5/1/22            |
| 137432270 | 5/15/21         | 10/31/22          |
| 144707760 | 9/1/22          | N/A               |
| 150514953 | 8/31/10         | 2/1/22            |

 

For our example, let’s say that we want to calculated the energy and emissions for the year 2022.  We can see that the property was bought in 5/1/2019 and sold on 11/15/2022, which means that we should not count any energy associated with any time after 11/15/2022.

Next, we see that meter 144707760 was activated on 9/1/22, so we should not count any energy associated with that meter for any period before 9/1/22 (if there is data found). We also see that all the rest of the meters were deactivated sometime during 2022, and we should not count any energy from them after each of their respective deactivation dates.

 

NOTE: If a meter does not have a Deactivation date, it means that it is still active.

 

Let’s calculate the energy associated with meter 137432270. Here is a screenshot of the meter entry page on ENERGYSTAR Portfolio Manager.

 

 

First, we should take account of all entries that span 2022 or have a start date or end date in 2022.

 

Next, we need to see if any of the entries cover a time period that includes a date bought, date sold, meter activation, or meter deactivation date. In this meter, the entry that spaces 10/31/22 – 12/31/22 includes the meter deactivation date (10/31/22) and the property date sold (11/15/22). In this case, since the meter deactivation date is earlier than the property date sold, we must exclude any energy associated with this meter attributed to any days after 10/31/22.

 

We can thus count the rest of the entries in the annual calculation. In the table below, we color the entries that are excluded from the annual calculations in red.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

| **Start Date** | **End Date** | **Usage (kWh)** |
| :------------- | :----------- | :-------------- |
| 11/1/21        | 12/31/21     | 19000           |
| 1/1/22         | 2/28/22      | 20223           |
| 3/1/22         | 4/30/22      | 18200           |
| 7/1/22         | 8/31/22      | 24000           |
| 8/31/22        | 10/31/22     | 50000           |
| 10/31/22       | 12/31/22     | 25000           |

 

The sum of the consumption values of the other entries is 112,423 kWh. However, since we only exclude days that are after a meter deactivation date, we also want to include the pro-rated amount of consumption, 403 kWh, associated with the first day of the last entry (the deactivation date). The sum of these values yields an annual total energy associated with this meter **112,826 kWh.**

 

-       Meter 137432270 - 2022 Total Energy: 112,826 kWh

 

Next, to determine how to characterize the emissions of this meter, we use the fact that has a type of ‘Electricity’ and a Space Assignment of ‘Common Areas’. From this combination, we know this meter contributes to Scope 2 emissions.

 

To differentiate between Scope 2 Location- and Market-Based emissions, we need to consider a few more parameters. Specifically, for electricity meters, we must check if there is any renewable energy.

 

1.     For common electric meters (i.e. ‘Grid Purchased’)

a.     Check the ‘Green Power’ column in the meter entry table.

                                               i.     If it is checked, then the amount of green energy associated with that entry is counted as ‘Off Site Renewable’

1.     This results in normally (grid) calculated Location-based emissions but zero (0) Market-based emissions

                                             ii.     If not checked, then the whole entry is counted as ‘Off Site Grid’

1.     Location-based emissions = Market-based emissions

2.     If the meter is On-Site Solar or On-Site Wind

a.     Check the ‘REC Ownership’ column

                                               i.     If ‘Owned’, the energy consumption is considered ‘On Site Renewable’

1.     This results in zero (0) Location & Market-based emissions

                                             ii.     If ‘Arbitrage’, the energy consumption is considered ‘Off Site Renewable’

1.     This results in zero (0) Market-based emissions

                                            iii.     If ‘Sold’, the energy consumption is considered ‘Off Site Grid’

1.     Emissions counted the same as for a common electricity meter

 

NOTE: The location-based and market-based emissions for fuel meters will always be equal, since fuels are counted as direct emissions based on their on-site combustion.

Let’s determine how much of our sample meter’s annual energy comes from renewable sources. Above, we observe that for the entry over the period [1/1/22 to 2/28/22], the ‘Green Power’ box is checked. When we open the ‘Green Power’ box, we can see that 10,000 kWh of the total comes from Renewable Sources.

 

 

With this, we can then determine the amount of energy from non-renewable sources in 2022.

To determine Location-based emissions, we multiply the total Annual Total Energy (including Offsite Renewable) by the eGRID emissions factor, which is based on the postalCode of the property. In this case, the emissions factor is 0.3709697 kgCO2e / kWh. Therefore, the total Scope 2 Location-based emissions associated with meter is [0.3709697 \* 112,826] = **41,855 kgCO2e**

 

To determine Market-based emissions, we multiply only the total Annual (Grid) Non-Renewable Energy by the eGRID emissions factor. This is because market-based accounting attributes zero emissions to the consumption of Offsite Renewable Energy (purchased via RECs, EACs). Therefore, the total Scope 2 Market-based emissions associated with meter is [0.3709697 \* 102,826] = **38,145 kgCO2e.**

For GRESB reporting, the process above should be repeated for all in-metric energy meters in ESPM. The annual energy (and emissions) values for all meters can then be summed across similar meter, space, and emissions types. Reported energy for each covered area is reported in aggregate (renewable + non-renewable), with a separate section to report the property’s total annual renewable energy.
