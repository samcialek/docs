## GHG Protocol Alignment

Abisko calculates all emissions in full accordance with the **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol.** 

- The most granular location-based emissions factors (e.g. EPA eGRID) are used for regions in which they are available
- Onsite green power is incorporated into location-based calculations.

  <Note>
    Offsite green power only impacts market-based emissions calculations, per GHG Protocol guidance.
  </Note>
