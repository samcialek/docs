Users can analyze monthly and annual performance trends at the meter, space, property, and portfolio levels in any unit and over any reporting period.

## Performance Tracking & Reporting

Track and report trends in energy, emissions, water, waste, and utility spending over time with:

- Interactive dashboards at the meter, property, and portfolio level
- Exportable reports in PDF and Excel formats
- Monthly & annual trends with data completeness and performance insights

Performance can also be contextualized against key frameworks and targets, including Building Performance Standard (BPS) compliance pathways, CRREM decarbonization pathways, internal sustainability goals and more.

### Performance Metrics

Performance trends are provided throughout the platform for the following metrics:

| Energy Metrics              | Emissions Metrics       | Water Metrics       | Waste Metrics   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| Total Energy (Usage & Cost) | Total (LB) Emissions\*  | Total Water         | Total Waste     |
| Energy Use Intensity        | Total (LB) Intensity    | Water Use Intensity | Landfill        |
| Electricity (Usage & Cost)  | Total (MB) Emissions    | Potable Water       | Recycled        |
| Fuel (Usage & Cost)         | Total (MB) Intensity    | Reclaimed Water     | Donated/Reused  |
| DHC (Usage & Cost)          | Direct Emissions        | Well Water          | Composted       |
| Green Power - Onsite        | Indirect (LB) Emissions |                     | Incinerated     |
| Green Power - Offsite       | Indirect (MB) Emissions |                     | Waste to Energy |
| Green Power - Exported      | Scope 1 Emissions       |                     | Other           |
|                             | Scope 2 Emissions       |                     |                 |
|                             | Scope 3 Emissions       |                     |                 |

\*LB = Location-based Emissions, MB = Market-based Emissions

### Units

Abisko allows users to configure the units used to display performance metrics across all tabs, tables, plots, and reports. Once set, unit selections persist throughout the user’s session. The following units can be set for energy, emissions, water and waste performance metrics:

| Type      | Unit Options                  |
| :-------- | :---------------------------- |
| Energy    | kWh, MWh, kBtu, MBtu, therms  |
| Emissions | kgCO2e, mtCO2e, lbCO2e, tCO2e |
| Water     | gallon, UKgallon, L, m3       |
| Waste     | lbs, kg, ton, tonne           |

### Reporting Periods

Abisko allows users to set specific 12-month base & reporting periods over which to view performance metrics and trends across properties and portfolios. [Click here to learn more.](/getting-started/reporting-period)
