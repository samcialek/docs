Benchmark comparison evaluates your building's energy performance against similar buildings or established standards. ENERGY STAR Score (1-100) is the most common benchmark, comparing you to the national building stock.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM provides ENERGY STAR scores. Abisko adds GRESB peer comparisons, climate zone adjustments, and historical trend benchmarking to show how you compare across multiple dimensions.

## Types of Benchmarks

| Benchmark | Basis | Use Case |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **ENERGY STAR Score** | National building stock | Certification, marketing |
| **GRESB Peer** | Similar asset class portfolios | Investor comparison |
| **Internal Portfolio** | Your own properties | Identify outliers |
| **Absolute Targets** | Science-based or regulatory | Compliance, net-zero |

## Understanding ENERGY STAR Score

```
Score Range:
1-24   → Bottom quartile
25-49  → Below median
50     → Median (typical building)
51-74  → Above median
75-100 → Top quartile (eligible for certification)
```

<Tip>
**Score of 75:** Means your building performs better than 75% of similar buildings nationally. This is the threshold for ENERGY STAR certification.
</Tip>

## What Affects Your Score

Factors that adjust expected consumption:
- Building size (GFA)
- Operating hours
- Worker density
- Climate zone
- Property use type (office, retail, etc.)
- Special features (data centers, labs)

<Warning>
**Apples to Apples:** ENERGY STAR normalizes for these factors, so a 75-score office in Phoenix is comparable to a 75-score office in Minneapolis, despite different absolute consumption.
