## GHG Protocol Alignment

Market-based emissions are calculated in accordance with the **GHG Protocol** and appropriately reflect the impacts of both onsite and offsite green power based on renewable energy certificate (REC) ownership.

## Performance Metrics

The following market-based emissions metrics are automatically calculated for the whole building any time data is updated for any applicable energy meter.

| Whole Building Metric                 | Definition                                                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total (Market-based) Emissions**    | _The sum of direct and indirect market-based emissions_                                                      |
| **Total (Market-based) Intensity**    | _Total (Market-based) Emissions / Gross Floor Area_                                                          |
| **Indirect (Market-based) Emissions** | _Emissions from electricity and district energy sources accounting for all onsite and offsite green power_   |
| **Direct Emissions**                  | _Emissions from fuels and energy sources burned onsite. These are the same as for location-based emissions._ |

## Emissions Factors

Market-based emissions calculations leverage the same underlying emissions factors that are used for location-based emissions.

<Note>
  Abisko applies the same emissions factors used by ESPM. Sources: [**ESPM**](https://energystar.my.site.com/PortfolioManager/s/article/What-Emissions-Factors-used-to-calculate-my-Emissions-1748914027605), [**EPA**](https://www.epa.gov/egrid/detailed-data)
</Note>

For select municipal markets, locally published emissions factors developed specifically for Building Performance Standards (BPS) are available to support more detailed **market-based emissions** analysis. These local market-based factors supplement national or eGRID-based factors and are currently available for New York City, Boston, and Seattle.

## Green Power

Market-based calculations account for both onsite and offsite green power, which is counted as zero-emissions electricity. To reflect this, electricity consumption is adjusted prior to calculating market-based emissions.

### Green Power Adjustments

- **Total Electricity**: Energy consumption associated with all onsite and grid electric meters, regardless of REC ownership status.
- **Total Onsite Green Power**: Electricity generated and used onsite for which RECs are owned.
- **Total Offsite Green Power**: The sum of all purchased and exported electricity and electricity generated onsite for which RECs are arbitraged.

<Check>
  **MB-Adjusted Electricity**: [Total Electricity] - [Onsite Green Power] - [Offsite Green Power]
</Check>

The adjusted electricity represents the net amount of grid electricity for which emissions are calculated.

## Methodology

<Note>
  The methodology slightly differs from calculating location-based emissions because **offsite green power** is also included in the electricity adjustment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="All in-metric energy meters are collected">
    - Whole building performance metrics are driven by **in-metric** meters. [Learn more](/meters/meter-status).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meter consumption is normalized into common units & calendar months">
    Consumption entries are broken down and reconstituted into monthly values for each meter.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly consumption values are aggregated by energy subtype">
    Monthly consumption totals are calculated for each energy subtype by aggregating values across meters of the same subtype.

    - e.g. total electricity consumption, total natural gas consumption
  </Step>
  <Step title="Electricity consumption totals are adjusted for green power">
    <Check>
      **MB-Adjusted Electricity**: [Total Electricity] - [Onsite Green Power] - [Offsite Green Power]
    </Check>
    - [Click here](/green-power/index) to learn more about green power.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Emissions values are calculated for each energy subtype">
    1. Emissions factors are determined by the energy subtype and property location
    2. Monthly energy values are multiplied by the appropriate emissions factor
  </Step>
  <Step title="Emissions values are aggregated by emissions type">
    Monthly emissions values are aggregated by emissions type to calculate direct, indirect and total market-based monthly emissions metrics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly emissions values are aggregated over rolling 12-month periods">
    Monthly values are rolled up to provide annual market-based emissions metrics for every possible 12-month reporting period.
  </Step>
