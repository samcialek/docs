Energy Use Intensity (EUI) measures energy consumption normalized by building size, expressed as kBtu per square foot per year. It's the primary metric for comparing building efficiency regardless of size.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM calculates whole-building EUI. Abisko extends this with landlord EUI, tenant EUI, and fuel-specific EUI breakdowns for deeper performance analysis.
</Note>

## How It's Calculated

```
EUI = Total Energy (kBtu) / Gross Floor Area (sq ft)
```

**Example:**
- Annual energy: 5,000,000 kBtu
- GFA: 100,000 sq ft
- EUI = 50 kBtu/sq ft/year

## Typical EUI by Building Type

| Building Type | Median EUI | High Performer |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| Office | 75-100 | Under 50 |
| Retail | 60-80 | Under 45 |
| Multifamily | 50-80 | Under 40 |
| Data Center | 400-1000+ | Varies widely |
| Warehouse | 25-45 | Under 20 |

<Warning>
**Comparison Caution:** EUI comparisons only make sense between similar building types. A data center will always have higher EUI than an office—that doesn't mean it's less efficient.
</Warning>

## Site vs Source EUI

| Type | What It Measures | When to Use |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| **Site EUI** | Energy delivered to building | On-site efficiency |
| **Source EUI** | Including generation/transmission losses | Full environmental impact |

See [Source vs Site EUI](/performance/source-site-eui) for details.
