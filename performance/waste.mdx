## Waste Performance Metrics

While energy and water performance metrics are based on metered consumption, waste metrics are based on how much waste is disposed. The algorithm outlined for energy and water metrics above also applies to waste, except for a few minor differences.

- Abisko performance metrics are only available at the **whole building** level

  <Warning>
    Waste meters cannot be assigned to individual spaces
  </Warning>
- As waste data can be entered in mass or volume units, Abisko normalizes all data into common mass units based on [published EPA factors](https://www.epa.gov/smm/volume-weight-conversion-factors-solid-waste).
- Each waste entry is broken down by disposal type, enabling monthly and annual metrics for total waste as well as breakdowns by individual disposal types, including:
  - Landfill
  - Recycled
  - Donated/Reused
  - Composted
  - Incinerated
  - Waste to Energy
  - Other

## Tracking Performance Metrics

Users can analyze waste performance across meters, properties and portfolios.

### Portfolio Level

1. **Portfolio  → Portfolio Trends → Waste**
   - Annual portfolio-level performance and data quality trends (whole building)
2. **Portfolio  → Property Trends → Waste**
   - Annual property-level performance and data quality trends (whole building)
4. **Portfolio  → Goals → Waste**
   - Annual property-level performance trends relative to reduction targets

### Property Level

2. **Property  → Annual Trends**
   - Annual property-level performance and data quality trends (whole building)
3. **Property  → Meter Exploration → Waste**
   - Monthly & annual meter-level performance and data quality trends
