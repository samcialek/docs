## Framework Alignment

Scope emissions are calculated in accordance with the **GHG Protocol** and **GRESB Guidelines**..

## Emissions Factors

Abisko applies geographically appropriate, government-published emissions factors at the subregional, provincial/state, or national level, depending on data availability. Emissions factors are updated on an annual basis, following updates published by the U.S. EPA.

### Properties located in North America

For U.S. properties, electricity-related emissions are calculated using U.S. EPA **eGRID** emissions factors, which represent grid-average emissions across 27 U.S. subregions. Emissions factors for non-electric energy subtypes (e.g. natural gas) are based on national average.

For Canadian properties, emissions associated with electricity, natural gas, and district energy (steam, hot water, and chilled water) are calculated using U.S. EPA–published emissions factors at the provincial level. Emissions factors for all other direct fuel types are based on national averages.

<Note>
  Abisko applies the same emissions factors used by ESPM. Sources: [**ESPM**](https://energystar.my.site.com/PortfolioManager/s/article/What-Emissions-Factors-used-to-calculate-my-Emissions-1748914027605), [**EPA**](https://www.epa.gov/egrid/detailed-data)
</Note>

### Properties located outside of North America

For properties located outside of North America, Abisko applies **country-level emissions factors** published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) for all energy subtypes, consistent with GHG Protocol guidance when subnational data is not available. Sources: [**IEA**](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/emissions-factors-2025)

## Green Power

[<u>Section 6.4.1</u>](https://ghgprotocol.org/scope-2-guidance) of the GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance states the following:

> Companies who are consuming energy directly from a generation facility that has sold certificates (either owned/operated equipment or a direct line) forfeit not only the right to claim those emissions in the market-based method but also the right to claim that emissions profile in the location-based method.

To adhere to GHG Protocol guidance, electricity generated onsite and consumed for which the associated RECs are sold or arbitraged is treated as grid electricity when calculating location-based emissions. The same applies to all electricity generated onsite and exported to the grid as well as green power that is purchased offsite or for which RECs are arbitraged.

### Green Power Adjustments

Electricity generated onsite and consumed for which RECs are owned does not contribute to location-based or market-based emissions. To reflect onsite green power, total electricity consumption must be adjusted prior to calculating location-based emissions.

- **Total Electricity**: Energy consumption associated with all onsite and grid electric meters, regardless of REC ownership status.
- **Total Onsite Green Power**: Electricity generated and used onsite for which RECs are owned.

<Check>
  **Scope-Adjusted Electricity**: [Total Electricity] - [Total Onsite Green Power]
</Check>

The adjusted electricity value represents the net amount of grid electricity for which location-based emissions are calculated.

## Performance Metrics

The following location-based emissions metrics are automatically calculated any time data is updated for any applicable energy meter.

| Metric                | Definition                                                                                                               |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope 1 Emissions** | _Direct emissions from onsite fuel combustion (e.g., natural gas, fuel oil) associated with landlord controlled spaces._ |
| **Scope 2 Emissions** | _Indirect emissions from energy generated offsite and associated with landlord controlled spaces._                       |
| **Scope 3 Emissions** | _All emissions from energy associated with tenant spaces._                                                               |

### Methodology

<Steps>
  <Step title="All energy meters associated with a space type are collected">
    - For whole building performance metrics all **in-metric** meters are used.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meter consumption is normalized into common units & calendar months">
    Consumption entries between meter activation & deactivation dates and property buy and sell dates are broken down and reconstituted into monthly values for each meter. Data outside of these boundaries is ignored.

    <Note>
      Monthly and annual emissions are separately calculated for each meter.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly consumption values are aggregated by energy and emissions type">
    Monthly consumption totals are calculated for each emissions scope by aggregating consumption values across meters assigned to the same scope.

    - e.g. scope 1 electricity consumption, total natural gas consumption
