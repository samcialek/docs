## Framework Alignment

Scope emissions are calculated in accordance with the **GHG Protocol** and **GRESB Guidelines.** They follow the same methodology used for calculating whole building [location-based](/performance/location-emissions) and [market-based](/performance/market-emissions) emissions, with an additional step of categorizing emissions based on landlord and tenant sources.

## Performance Metrics

The following scope emissions metrics are automatically calculated any time data is updated for any applicable energy meter.

| Metric                                 | Definition                                                                                         |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope 1 Emissions**                  | _Direct emissions from onsite fuel combustion associated with landlord spaces._                    |
| **Scope 2 (Location-based) Emissions** | _Indirect location-based emissions from energy generated offsite associated with landlord spaces._ |
| **Scope 2 (Market-based) Emissions**   | _Indirect market-based emissions from energy generated offsite associated with landlord spaces._   |
| **Scope 3 Emissions**                  | _All emissions from energy associated with tenant spaces._                                         |

## Emissions Factors

Scope emissions calculations use the same underlying emissions factors applied in whole building location-based and market-based emissions calculations. These factors are applied consistently across scopes, with emissions subsequently allocated to Scope 1, Scope 2, or Scope 3 based on the source of energy consumption and ownership or control boundaries.

## Green Power

To adhere to GHG Protocol guidance, electricity generated onsite and consumed for which the associated RECs are sold or arbitraged is treated as grid electricity when calculating location and market-based scope emissions. Furthermore, any electricity generated onsite and exported to the grid or purchased offsite only impacts market-based calculations.

### Green Power Adjustments

Onsite and offsite green power is counted as zero-emissions electricity. To reflect this, electricity consumption is adjusted prior to calculating scope 2 location-based and market-based emissions.

- **Total Electricity**: Energy consumption associated with all onsite and grid electric meters, regardless of REC ownership status.
- **Total Onsite Green Power**: Electricity generated and used onsite for which RECs are owned.
- **Total Offsite Green Power**: The sum of all purchased and exported electricity and electricity generated onsite for which RECs are arbitraged.

<Check>
  **LB-Adjusted Electricity**: [Total Electricity] - [Onsite Green Power]

  - For Scope 1,2,3 calculations, this adjustment is made for each individual meter prior to aggregation.
</Check>

<Check>
  **MB-Adjusted Electricity**: [Total Electricity] - [Onsite Green Power] - [Offsite Green Power]

  - For Scope 1,2,3 calculations, only scope 2 electricity total consumption is adjusted.
</Check>

The adjusted electricity value represents the net amount of grid electricity for which location-based emissions are calculated.

## Scope Mappings

Scope 1, 2 and 3 categorization depends on the combination of energy and space type.

<Note>
  Updated GRESB guidance (2025) attributes all energy associated with tenant spaces to Scope 3 emissions, regardless of control type.
</Note>

## Methodology

The methodology for calculating scope emissions extends location-based and market-based calculations by incorporating landlord and tenant spaces.

<Steps>
  <Step title="The energy reporting level for each property is determined">
    - Click here to learn how to set the reporting level.
  </Step>
  <Step title="All applicable energy meters are collected based on reporting level">
    - If **Reporting Level** = **Whole Building** **→ **All in-metric meters are collected.
    - If **Reporting Level** = **Split** **→ **All meters (in-metric & out-of-metric) are collected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meter consumption is normalized into common units & calendar months">
    Consumption entries are broken down and reconstituted into monthly values for each meter.
  </Step>
  <Step title="For electricity meters, consumption totals are adjusted for onsite green power.">
    <Note>
      For scope emissions calculations, onsite green power is independently accounted for each onsite electricity meter based on REC ownership.
    </Note>
    <Check>
      **LB-Adjusted Meter Electricity**: [Meter Electricity] - [Onsite Green Power]
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="The scope type is determined for each meter">
    The scope type is determined for each meter by evaluating the meter type, meter space assignment and property reporting level based on the [scope mappings](#scope-mappings).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly consumption values are aggregated by energy subtype for each scope type.">
    Monthly energy consumption totals are calculated by aggregating consumption values across meters of the same energy subtype for each scope type.

    e.g. Scope 1 Natural Gas, Scope 2 Electricity, Scope 3 Natural Gas, Scope 3 Electricity
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scope 2 electricty totals are adjusted for offsite green power when applicable.">
    For location-based emissions, no adjustments are made because **offsite green power** does not impact location-based emissions.

    For market-based emissions, scope 2 electricity totals are adjusted by further subtracting offsite green power. Onsite green power was already adjusted in **Step 4.**

    <Check>
      **MB-Adjusted Scope 2 Electricity**: [Total Electricity] - [Offsite Green Power]
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly emissions values are calculated for each scope type.">
    1. Emissions factors are determined by the energy subtype and property location.
    2. Monthly energy values are multiplied by the appropriate emissions factor.
       - Location-based calculations use original scope 2 electricity values
       - Market-based calculations use **MB-adjusted scope 2 electricity values**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly emissions values are aggregated over rolling 12-month periods">
    Monthly values are rolled up to provide annual location-based and market-based emissions metrics for every possible 12-month reporting period.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Values are further rolled up into portfolio-level insights.">
    Monthly and annual emissions values are aggregated across all properties to enable portfolio-level views.
  </Step>
</Steps>
