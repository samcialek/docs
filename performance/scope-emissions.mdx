## Framework Alignment

Scope emissions are calculated in accordance with the **GHG Protocol** and **GRESB Guidelines.** They follow the same methodology used for calculating whole building [location-based](/performance/location-emissions) and [market-based](/performance/market-emissions) emissions, with an additional step of categorizing emissions based on landlord and tenant sources.

## Performance Metrics

The following scope emissions metrics are automatically calculated any time data is updated for any applicable energy meter.

| Metric                                 | Definition                                                                                         |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope 1 Emissions**                  | _Direct emissions from onsite fuel combustion associated with landlord spaces._                    |
| **Scope 2 (Location-based) Emissions** | _Indirect location-based emissions from energy generated offsite associated with landlord spaces._ |
| **Scope 2 (Market-based) Emissions**   | _Indirect market-based emissions from energy generated offsite associated with landlord spaces._   |
| **Scope 3 Emissions**                  | _All emissions from energy associated with tenant spaces._                                         |

## Emissions Factors

Scope emissions calculations use the same underlying emissions factors applied in whole building location-based and market-based emissions calculations. These factors are applied consistently across scopes, with emissions subsequently allocated to Scope 1, Scope 2, or Scope 3 based on the source of energy consumption and ownership or control boundaries.

## Green Power

To adhere to GHG Protocol guidance, electricity generated onsite and consumed for which the associated RECs are sold or arbitraged is treated as grid electricity when calculating location and market-based scope emissions. Furthermore, any electricity generated onsite and exported to the grid or purchased offsite only impacts market-based calculations.

### Green Power Adjustments

Onsite and offsite green power is counted as zero-emissions electricity. To reflect this, total electricity consumption must be adjusted prior to calculating scope 2 location-based and market-based emissions.

- **Total Electricity**: Energy consumption associated with all onsite and grid electric meters, regardless of REC ownership status.
- **Total Onsite Green Power**: Electricity generated and used onsite for which RECs are owned.
- **Total Offsite Green Power**: The sum of all purchased and exported electricity and electricity generated onsite for which RECs are arbitraged.

<Check>
  **LB-Adjusted Electricity**: [Total Electricity] - [Onsite Green Power]
</Check>

<Check>
  **MB-Adjusted Electricity**: [Total Electricity] - [Onsite Green Power] - [Offsite Green Power]
</Check>

The adjusted electricity value represents the net amount of grid electricity for which location-based emissions are calculated.

## Scope Mappings

Scope 1, 2 and 3 categorization depends on the combination of energy and space type.

<Note>
  Recently updated guidance attributes all energy associated with tenant spaces to Scope 3 emissions, regardless of controll type.
</Note>

## Methodology

The methodology for calculating scope emissions extends location-based and market-based calculations by incorporating landlord and tenant spaces.

<Steps>
  <Step title="All energy meters associated with a space type are collected">
    - For whole building performance metrics all **in-metric** meters are used.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meter consumption is normalized into common units & calendar months">
    Consumption entries between meter activation & deactivation dates and property buy and sell dates are broken down and reconstituted into monthly values for each meter. Data outside of these boundaries is ignored.

    <Note>
      Monthly and annual emissions are separately calculated for each meter.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly consumption values are aggregated by energy and emissions type">
    Monthly consumption totals are calculated for each emissions scope by aggregating consumption values across meters assigned to the same scope.

    - e.g. scope 1 electricity consumption, total natural gas consumption
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly total electricity consumption totals are adjusted for green power">
    <Check>
      **LB-Adjusted Electricity**: [Total Electricity] - [Onsite Green Power]
    </Check>
    <Warning>
      Electricity that generated onsite and consumed for which the associated RECs are sold or abritraged is treated as regular grid electricity when calculating **location-based emissions**.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly emissions values are calculated for each energy subtype">
    1. Emissions factors are determined by the energy subtype and property location
    2. Monthly energy values are multiplied by the appropriate emissions factor
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly emissions values are aggregated by emissions type.">
    Monthly emissions values are aggregated by emissions type to calculate direct, indirect and total location-based monthly emissions metrics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly emissions values are aggregated over rolling 12-month periods">
    Monthly values are rolled up to provide annual location-based emissions metrics for every possible 12-month reporting period.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Values are further rolled up into portfolio-level insights.">
    Monthly and annual emissions values are aggregated across all properties to enable portfolio-level views.
  </Step>
</Steps>
