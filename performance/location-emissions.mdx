## GHG Protocol Alignment

Location-based emissions are calculated in accordance with the **GHG Protocol** using average emissions factors that reflect the emissions intensity of the physical energy supply at the location where consumption occurs.

## Performance Metrics

The following location-based emissions metrics are automatically calculated for the whole building any time data is updated for any applicable energy meter.

| Whole Building Metric                   | Definition                                                |
| :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total (Location-based) Emissions**    | _The sum of direct and indirect location-based emissions_ |
| **Total (Location-based) Intensity**    | _Total (Locatiob-based) Emissions / Gross Floor Area_     |
| **Indirect (Location-based) Emissions** | _Emissions from electricity and district energy sources_  |
| **Direct Emissions**                    | _Emissions from fuels and energy sources burned onsite_   |

## Emissions Factors

Abisko applies geographically appropriate, government-published emissions factors at the subregional, provincial/state, or national level, depending on data availability. Emissions factors are updated on an annual basis, following updates published by the U.S. EPA.

### North America

For U.S. properties, electricity-related emissions are calculated using U.S. EPA **eGRID** emissions factors, which represent grid-average emissions across 27 U.S. subregions. Emissions factors for non-electric energy subtypes (e.g. natural gas) are based on national average.

For Canadian properties, emissions associated with electricity, natural gas, and district energy (steam, hot water, and chilled water) are calculated using U.S. EPA–published emissions factors at the provincial level. Emissions factors for all other direct fuel types are based on national averages.

<Note>
  Abisko applies the same emissions factors used by ESPM. Sources: [**ESPM**](https://energystar.my.site.com/PortfolioManager/s/article/What-Emissions-Factors-used-to-calculate-my-Emissions-1748914027605), [**EPA**](https://www.epa.gov/egrid/detailed-data)
</Note>

### International

For properties located outside of North America, Abisko applies **country-level emissions factors** published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) for all energy subtypes, consistent with GHG Protocol guidance when subnational data is not available. Sources: [**IEA**](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/emissions-factors-2025)

## Green Power

[Section 6.4.1](https://ghgprotocol.org/scope-2-guidance) of the GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance states the following:

> Companies who are consuming energy directly from a generation facility that has sold certificates (either owned/operated equipment or a direct line) forfeit not only the right to claim those emissions in the market-based method but also the right to claim that emissions profile in the location-based method.

To adhere to GHG Protocol guidance, electricity generated onsite and consumed for which the associated RECs are sold or arbitraged is treated as grid electricity when calculating location-based emissions. Furthermore, any electricity generated onsite and exported to the grid or purchased offsite does not impact location-based calculations.

### Green Power Adjustments

Electricity generated onsite and consumed for which RECs are owned is counted as zero-emissions electricity. To reflect this onsite green power, total electricity consumption must be adjusted prior to calculating location-based emissions.

- **Total Electricity**: Energy consumption associated with all onsite and grid electric meters, regardless of REC ownership status.
- **Total Onsite Green Power**: Electricity generated and used onsite for which RECs are owned.

<Check>
  **LB-Adjusted Electricity**: [Total Electricity] - [Onsite Green Power]
</Check>

The adjusted electricity value represents the net amount of grid electricity for which location-based emissions are calculated.

## Methodology

![Group 1000002839](/images/Group1000002839.png)

<Steps>
  <Step title="All in-metric energy meters associated are collected">
    - Whole building performance metrics are driven by **in-metric** meters. [Learn more](/meters/meter-status).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meter consumption is normalized into common units & calendar months">
    Consumption entries between meter activation & deactivation dates and property buy and sell dates are broken down and reconstituted into monthly values for each meter. Data outside of these boundaries is ignored.

    <Note>
      Monthly and annual emissions are separately calculated for each meter.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly consumption values are aggregated by energy subtype">
    Monthly consumption totals are calculated for each energy subtype by aggregating values across meters of the same subtype.

    - e.g. total electricity consumption, total natural gas consumption
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly total electricity consumption totals are adjusted for green power">
    <Check>
      **LB-Adjusted Electricity**: [Total Electricity] - [Onsite Green Power]
    </Check>
    <Warning>
      Electricity that generated onsite and consumed for which the associated RECs are sold or abritraged is treated as regular grid electricity when calculating **location-based emissions**.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly emissions values are calculated for each energy subtype">
    1. Emissions factors are determined by the energy subtype and property location
    2. Monthly energy values are multiplied by the appropriate emissions factor
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly emissions values are aggregated by emissions type">
    Monthly emissions values are aggregated by emissions type to calculate direct, indirect and total location-based monthly emissions metrics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly emissions values are aggregated over rolling 12-month periods">
    Monthly values are rolled up to provide annual location-based emissions metrics for every possible 12-month reporting period.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Values are further rolled up into portfolio-level insights">
    Monthly and annual emissions values are aggregated across all properties to enable portfolio-level views.
  </Step>
</Steps>
