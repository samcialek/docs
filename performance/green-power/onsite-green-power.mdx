On-site green power is renewable electricity generated at your property, typically from rooftop solar, building-integrated PV, or small wind turbines.

## Types of On-site Generation

| Type | Common Applications | Considerations |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Rooftop Solar** | Office, retail, warehouse | Roof condition, orientation |
| **Carport Solar** | Parking structures | Shade, EV charging synergy |
| **Building-integrated PV** | Facades, windows | Aesthetics, efficiency |
| **Small Wind** | Rural properties | Zoning, noise |

## Accounting for On-site Generation

On-site generation affects your data in multiple ways:

```
Grid Import = Total Consumption - On-site Generation
Net Export = On-site Generation - Building Consumption (if excess)
```

<Warning>
**REC Ownership:** If you sell RECs generated by on-site solar, you cannot claim the emissions benefit. Track whether RECs are retained or sold.
</Warning>
