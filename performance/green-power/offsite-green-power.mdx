Off-site green power is renewable electricity procured from sources outside your property boundaries, typically through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), green utility tariffs, or virtual power agreements.

## Types of Off-site Procurement

| Type | How It Works | REC Treatment |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Physical PPA** | Contract with specific project, power delivered | Bundled RECs included |
| **Virtual PPA (VPPA)** | Financial contract, no physical delivery | RECs transferred separately |
| **Green Tariff** | Utility program for renewable supply | RECs retired by utility |
| **Unbundled RECs** | Purchase certificates only | Apply to market-based |
