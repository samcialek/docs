RECs (Renewable Energy Certificates) are tradeable certificates representing the environmental attributes of renewable electricity generation. Purchasing and retiring RECs reduces your market-based Scope 2 emissions.

## How RECs Work

```
1 REC = Environmental attributes of 1 MWh renewable electricity
```

When you purchase and retire a REC, you claim the "green" benefit of that renewable generation, reducing your market-based emissions to zero for that amount of electricity.

## REC Requirements for GRESB

To count RECs toward market-based emissions reduction:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Vintage** | Must be from same reporting year (or within 12 months) |
| **Retirement** | Must be retired (not resold) |
| **Documentation** | Quantity and source documented |
| **Geography** | Should match grid region when possible |

<Warning>
**Double Counting:** If you sell RECs from on-site solar, you cannot claim those environmental benefits. The buyer of the REC gets the emissions reduction.
</Warning>
