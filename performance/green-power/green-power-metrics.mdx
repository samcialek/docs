Abisko calculates **Green Power** metrics in full accordance with the **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol**, including onsite & offsite green power totals across properties and portfolios.

## Performance Metrics

**Green Power** metrics are critical for properly reporting location and market-based emissions. Abisko rigorously tracks and reports multiple **Green Power** performance metrics and disaggregations, including:

<Note>
  Green power metrics are not all mutually exclusive to enable different levels of reporting.
</Note>

| Green Power   | Definition                                                                      |
| :------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Offsite Total | The sum of all purchased, exported, and arbitraged green power.                 |
| Onsite Total  | Green power generated and used onsite for which RECs are owned.                 |
| Purchased     | Green power associated with offsite green power purchases.                      |
| Exported      | Green power generated onsite & exported for which RECs are owned or arbitraged. |
| Arbitraged    | Green power generated onsite & used or exported for which RECs are arbitraged.  |

Each metric depends on the ownership status of the renewable energy certificates (RECs) associated with the purchased, generated, consumed, or exported green power.

**The following diagram show green power is classified based on REC ownership..**

## Onsite Green Power

Onsite green power metrics are derived from onsite renewable wind and solar meters that generate electricity that is used onsite or exported to the grid.

### Methodology

The following methodology is used to calculated green power metrics based on onsite generated  renewable electricity.

<Steps>
  <Step title="All onsite solar and wind meters associated with a space type are collected">
    - For whole building performance metrics all **in-metric** meters are used.
    - For a space type (e.g. common areas) all meters assigned to that space type are used.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meter entries are broken down into daily values">
    Onsite renewable meters have separate entries for tracking energy that is used onsite and exported to the grid. Each entry is broken down into daily values.
  </Step>
  <Step title="REC entries are collected and broken down into daily values">
    Onsite renewable meters independently track REC ownership statuses for energy that is used onsite and exported to the grid. Each REC entry is broken down into daily values to enable tracking REC ownership status for each day.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Daily meter entries and REC ownership statuses are matched for each day">
    Daily energy consumption and exported values are matched to their corresponding REC ownership statutes for each day of every entry.

    e.g. Sample table of matching daily values across energy & REC meter entries

    | Date       | Energy - Used | REC Ownership | Energy - Exported | REC Ownership |
    | ---------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
    | 5/30/2025  | 33,000 kWh    | Owned         | 10,000 kWh        | Owned         |
    | 5/31/2025  | 33,000 kWh    | Owned         | 10,000 kWh        | Owned         |
    | 6/1/2025   | 27,500 kWh    | Sold          | 15,000 kWh        | Arbitraged    |
    | 6/2/2025   | 27,500 kWh    | Sold          | 15,000 kWh        | Arbitraged    |
    | ...        |               |               |                   |               |
    | 12/31/2025 | 5,250 kWh     | Arbitraged    | 15,000 kWh        | Sold          |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Daily green power values are calculated">
    For each day, green power values are determined based on the REC ownership status using the diagram above.

    <Warning>
      Any energy that is generated and used onsite for which RECs are sold is treated as non-renewable grid electricity with non-zero emissions, per GHG Protocol guidelines.
    </Warning>
    **Energy - Used Onsite**

    - If REC is owned **→** counts as **Green Power - Onsite**
    - If REC is abritraged **→** counts as **Green Power - Offsite** and **Green Power - Arbitraged**
    - If REC is sold **→** counts as **Non-Renewable Grid Electricity**

    **Energy - Exported to Grid**

    - If REC is owned ******→****** counts as **Green Power - Offsite** and **Green Power - Exported**
    - If REC is abritraged ******→****** counts as **Green Power - Offsite** and **Green Power - Exported**
    - If REC is sold **→** does not count toward any metric
  </Step>
  <Step title="Daily values are rolled up into monthly values">
    After daily values are assessed based on REC ownership status, all values are rolled up into corresponding monthly values for **Green Power - Onsite, Green Power - Offsite, Green Power - Arbitraged, Green Power - Exported, Non-Renewable Grid Electricity**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly values are aggregated over rolling 12-month periods">
    Monthly values are rolled up to provide annual metrics for every 12-month reporting period.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Green power is reported separately from total energy consumption for onsite renewable meters. Consumption during periods covered by owned RECs is assigned zero emissions.
</Note>

## Offsite Green Power

### Methodology

The following methodology is used to calculate total **Green Power - Offsite** performance metrics.

<Steps>
  <Step title="All green power purchase entries are collected">
    <Note>
      All tracked green power purchases are assumed, by definition, to include ownership of the associated renewable energy certificates (RECs).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Entries are normalized into common units & calendar months">
    - If an entry is based on a fixed purchase amount, that amount is normalized based on the start and end dates of the entry.
    - If the entry is based on a percentage of the consumption associated with one or more meters, then the meter consumption values of all selected meters are normalized over the purchase period, aggregated across relevant meters and then multiplied by the percentage entered for the entry.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly values are aggregated over rolling 12-month periods">
    Monthly normalized values are rolled across all purchases up to provide annual green power values for every 12-month reporting period.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly & annual values are combined with other offsite green power">
    The following values associated with onsite renewable meters are combined with green power purchase to yield total **Green Power - Offsite** performance metrics:

    - Onsite generated green power that is used for which RECs are arbitraged
    - Onsite generated green power that is exported for which RECs are owned or arbitraged
  </Step>
</Steps>
