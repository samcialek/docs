## Onsite Green Power & RECs

Onsite meter RECs

## Offsite Green Power Purchases

Offsite green power refers to any renewable electricity procured from external sources. Users can track green power purchased directly in Abisko, which also offset market-based emissions.

### Adding, Editing & Deleting Green Power Purchases

### To add a green power purchase

**Navigate to Property → Green Power → Green Power Purchases**

1. Click on the **Add Purchase** button in the top-right of the tab

   <Note>
     For ESPM properties, green power purchases must be managed directly in ESPM.
   </Note>
2. Enter all required information for the green power purchase entry
   - Start Date
   - End Date
   - Amount
     - Fixed Amount: The amount of green power purchased between the start and end dates
     - Percentage: Users can specify what percentage of consumption associated with one or more meters should be counted as offsite green power

       <Tip>
         The percentage option allows users to easily track the amount of green power associated with meters under specific utility contracts without having to retroactively calculate and enter the amount of green power.\
         \
         e.g. A direct purchase contract may stipulate that 50% of all electricity provided to the site comes from renewable sources.
