## Factors

Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are categorized based on the combination of the following factors.

### Energy Reporting Level

The reporting level determines the process by which scope emissions are categorized.

- **Whole Building (Landlord Controlled)** → Scope emissions are based on in-metric meters and categorized as Scope 1 or Scope 2 based on the energy subtype.
- **Whole Building (Tenant Controlled)** → Scope emissions are based on in-metric meters and categorized as Scope 3 regardless of energy subtype.
- **Split (Landlord vs. Tenant)** → Scope emissions are based on all meters (in-metric, out-of-metric) and categorized as Scope 1, Scope 2 or Scope 3 based on the combination of energy subtype and space assignment.

### Energy Type

Energy meters are categorized into three main types: electricity, fuel and district hearing & cooling (DHC). These types help determine scope categorizations as seen in the table below.

### Meter Space Assignment

When **Energy Reporting Level = Split (Landlord vs. Tenant),** the space to which a meter is assigned helps determine the emissions scope to which it contributes.

## Scope Mappings

<Note>
  Updated GRESB guidance (2025) attributes all energy associated with tenant spaces to Scope 3 emissions, regardless of control type.
