Scope emissions calculations are driven by several factors that determine which meters are included in the analysis and how the associated consumption is categorized. This section describes how each factor contributes to the calculation of Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions.

## Energy Reporting Level

The reporting level determines which meters to include in calculating scope emissions.

- **Whole Building (Landlord Controlled)** → Scope 1 & Scope 2 emissions are driven by consumption from all in-metric meters and categorized based on energy type.
- **Whole Building (Tenant Controlled)** → Scope 3 emissions are driven by consumption from all in-metric meters and always categorized as Scope 3.
- **Split (Landlord vs. Tenant)** → Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions are driven by consumption from all meters assigned to a [space type](/meters/meter-space-assignments) and categorized based on energy type.

**Energy Types**: Energy meters are categorized into three primary types to determine whether the associated emissions are classified as Scope 1, Scope 2 or Scope 3.

## Whole Building Scope Mappings

When the reporting level is set to whole building, all in-metric energy meters are included in scope emissions calculations, consistent with other [whole building performance metrics](/meters/meter-status). Emissions are then classified as Scope 1, Scope 2, or Scope 3 based on the type of energy consumed and whether the building is landlord or tenant controlled.

| Reporting Level                      | Energy type | GHG Scope | Meters Used          |
| :----------------------------------- | :---------- | :-------- | :------------------- |
| Whole Building (Landlord Controlled) | Fuel        | Scope 1   | All in-metric meters |
| Whole Building (Landlord Controlled) | DH&C        | Scope 2   | All in-metric meters |
| Whole Building (Landlord Controlled) | Electricity | Scope 2   | All in-metric meters |
| Whole Building (Tenant Controlled)   | Fuel        | Scope 3   | All in-metric meters |
| Whole Building (Tenant Controlled)   | DH&C        | Scope 3   | All in-metric meters |
| Whole Building (Tenant Controlled)   | Electricity | Scope 3   | All in-metric meters |

## Split (Landlord vs. Tenant) Scope Mappings

When the reporting level is set to Split (Landlord vs. Tenant), all energy meters that are assigned to a landlord or tenant space, regardless of whether they are in-metric or out-of-metric, are included in scope emissions calculations. Emissions are then classified as Scope 1, Scope 2 or Scope 3 based on the type of energy consumed and the space to which the meter is assigned.

The table below illustrates how energy consumption is mapped to Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions when the reporting level is set to **Split (Landlord vs. Tenant)**.

In 2026, [GRESB reclassified](https://cdn.svc.gresb.com/gresb-prd-public/2025/Foundation/Real_Estate_Standard_2026_Updates.pdf) emissions associated with landlord controlled tenant spaces:

> _The 2026 Standard reclassifies GHG emissions from landlord-controlled tenant spaces as Scopes 1–2 and updates the reporting guidance and validation checks accordingly._

| Space Type                          | Energy Type | GHG Scope | Meters Used                        |

## Outdoor / Exterior / Parking Emissions

Scope 1,2,3 emissions associated with outdoor, exterior and parking space types are reported separately from building emissions, but they are still classified as Scope 1, Scope 2 or Scope 3 based on the type of energy consumed and the space to which a meter is assigned.

A few notes about outdoor / exterior / parking emissions:

- Only electricity & fuel can be assigned to outdoor spaces.
- When **Reporting Level = Whole Building**, only out-of-metric meters can be assigned to outdoor areas because all in-metric meters are used for whole building reporting.
