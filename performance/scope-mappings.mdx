## Energy Reporting Level

The reporting level determines which meters to include in calculating scope emissions.

- **Whole Building (Landlord Controlled)** → Scope 1 & Scope 2 emissions are driven by consumption from all in-metric meters and categorized based on energy subtype.
- **Whole Building (Tenant Controlled)** → Scope 3 emissions are driven by consumption from all in-metric meters and always categorized as Scope 3.
- **Split (Landlord vs. Tenant)** → Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions that are driven by consumption from all meters (in-metric or out-of-metric) assigned to a [space type](/meters/meter-space-assignments) and categorized based on energy subtype.

## Whole Building Scope Mappings

Consistent with other [whole building performance metrics](/meters/meter-status), when the reporting level is set to whole building, all in-metric energy meters are used to calculate scope emissions. The control type (landlord or tenant) is then used to assign emissions to Scope 1, Scope 2, or Scope 3 based on the type of energy consumed.

| Reporting Level                      | Energy type | GHG Scope | Meters Used          |
| :----------------------------------- | :---------- | :-------- | :------------------- |
| Whole Building (Landlord Controlled) | Fuel        | Scope 1   | All in-metric meters |
| Whole Building (Landlord Controlled) | DH&C        | Scope 2   | All in-metric meters |
| Whole Building (Landlord Controlled) | Electricity | Scope 2   | All in-metric meters |
| Whole Building (Tenant Controlled)   | Fuel        | Scope 3   | All in-metric meters |
| Whole Building (Tenant Controlled)   | DH&C        | Scope 3   | All in-metric meters |
| Whole Building (Tenant Controlled)   | Electricity | Scope 3   | All in-metric meters |

## Split (Landlord vs. Tenant) Scope Mappings

When the reporting level is set to Split (Landlord vs. Tenant), all energy meters that are assigned to landlord or tenant space, regardless of whether they are in-metric or out-of-metric, are used to calculate scope emissions. The space is then used to assign emissions to Scope 1, Scope 2, or Scope 3 based on the type of energy consumed.

<Note>
  Updated GRESB guidance (2025) attributes all energy associated with tenant spaces to Scope 3 emissions, regardless of control type.

### Meter Space Assignment

All meters, regardless of whether they are in-metric or out-of-metric, can be assigned to space types to support [space-based performance](/spaces/performance) reporting and [Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions reporting](/performance/scope-emissions). This enables users to track data coverage and performance by space type, as well as to understand differences between base building (landlord) and tenant-controlled spaces.

### Energy Type

Energy meters are categorized into three main types to help determine whether the associated emisisons are counted as Scope 1, Scope 2 or Scope 3.
