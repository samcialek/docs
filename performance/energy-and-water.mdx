Abisko automatically calculates performance metrics using a powerful analytics engine that enables users to analyze monthly and annual performance trends across meters, spaces, properties, and portfolios.

## Performance Metrics Calculations

The following section outlines the away Abisko calculates monthly and annual performance metrics across space, property and portfolio levels. 

The diagram below shows how data is rolled up from meters associated to a specific space type to provide higher-level performance insights.

### Methodology

<Steps>
  <Step title="All meters associated with a space type are collected">
    - For whole building performance metrics all **in-metric** meters are used.
    - For a space type (e.g. common areas) all meters assigned to that space type are used.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meter consumption is normalized into calendar months">
    - Consumption entries between meter activation & deactivation dates and property buy and sell dates are broken down and reconstituted into monthly values for each meter.

    <Note>
      Consumption outside meter activation and property ownership periods is ignored
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly consumption values are aggregated by meter type and subtype">
    Meters are grouped by subtype and subtypes are grouped into higher-level types, to enable performance metrics at multiple resolutions.

    <Accordion title="Meter categories, subtypes and types" icon="sparkles">
      | Meter Category | Subtype                | Type     |

    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly consumption data is aggregated over rolling 12-month periods">
    - For every meter type and subtype, monthly normalized values are rolled up to provide annual consumption values for every possible 12-month reporting period.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Steps 1-4 are repeated for every space type, meter type and subtype">
    Monthly and annual consumption values are automatically calculated and updated for every combination of space type, meter type and meter subtype.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Values are further rolled up into portfolio-level insights.">
    Monthly and annual consumption values are aggregated across all spaces and properties to enable portfolio-level views.
  </Step>
</Steps>
