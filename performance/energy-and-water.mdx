Abisko automatically calculates performance metrics using a powerful analytics engine that enables users to analyze monthly and annual performance trends across meters, spaces, properties, and portfolios.

## Performance Metrics Calculations

The following algorithm is used for calculating monthly and annual performance metrics for each meter and rolling up values to the property and portfolio levels:

### Methodology

<Steps>
  <Step title="All meters associated with the target space type are collected">
    - For whole building performance metrics all **in-metric** meters are used.
    - For a space type (e.g. common areas) all meters assigned to that space type are used.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meter consumption is normalized into calendar months">
    - Consumption entries between the meter activation & deactivation dates and the property buy and sell dates are broken down and aggregated into monthly values for each meter.

    <Note>
      Consumption outside meter activation and property ownership periods is ignored
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly consumption values are aggregated by meter type and subtype">
    Meter types simplify reporting by grouping more granular subtypes. Abisko calculates metrics based on both to enable users to drill down to different data resolutions.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly consumption data is aggregated over rolling 12-month periods">
    - For every meter type and subtype, monthly normalized values are further aggregated to provide annual consumption values for every possible 12-month reporting period.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Steps 1-4 are repeated for every space type, meter type and subtype">
    Monthly and annual consumption values are automatically calculated and updated for every combination of space type, meter type and meter subtype.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Values are further rolled up into portfolio-level insights.">
    Monthly and annual consumption values are aggregated across all spaces and properties to enable portfolio-level views.
  </Step>
</Steps>
