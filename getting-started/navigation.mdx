## Universal Search

At the top of Abisko, users can find a universal search bar in which they can search for properties, groups and other account portfolios.

<Note>
  The universal search bar is always available and allows users to jump between properties and portfolios at any time. Furthermore, it keeps the context from the original location, meaning that if a user jumps from within a specific tab (e.g. performance, compliance) in a property, they will jump to the same tab in the destination property. This ensures a smooth user experience.
</Note>

### **To use the search bar**

- Click on the search bar at the top of the application
- Start typing the name of a property or portfolio
  - The search bar will begin to autofill based on your search
  - Properties, groups and accounts will be displayed with distinct colors and icons

## Quickly Jump from a Property to Portfolio

Users can quickly jump back up to a group or account from within a property.

<Note>
  Jumping from a property to portfolio maintains the context when applicable. If a user jumps from within a specific tab in a property (e.g. GRESB), they will land in the same tab at the portfolio level. If a tab only exists at the property level, then the user will land in portfolio dashboard tab by default.
</Note>

### **To navigate back up to a group or account**

## Quickly Jump from a Portfolio to Property

Users can quickly jump to a property by clicking the property name within any portfolio tab or plot.

<Note>
  Jumping from a property from a portfolio maintains the context when applicable. This means that if a user clicks a property within a specific portfolio-level tab (e.g. GRESB / Measures), they will land in the same tab at the property level.
</Note>

### **To navigate to a property from within a portfolio banner**

- Click on the properties link in the property banner to open a sidebar with a list of all properties in the portfolio
