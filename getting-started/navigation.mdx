As users navigate between properties and portfolios, they will remain in the most applicable tabs based on their workflow. For example, if a user jumps from the portfolio-level **Property Trends** tab to a property, they will land in the property-level **Annual Trends** tab. This provides an intuitive and efficient experience for all users.

## Universal Search

At the top of the application, users can find a universal search bar from which they can navigate to properties, groups and other account portfolios.

### **To use the search bar**

- Click on the search bar at the top of the application
- Start typing the name of a property or portfolio
  - The search bar will begin to autofill based on your search
  - Matching properties and portfolios will be displayed with distinct colors and icons
- Click on the property or portfolio to which you want to navigate
