## Universal Search

At the top of Abisko, users can find a universal search bar from which they can navigte to properties, groups and other account portfolios.

<Note>
  The universal search bar is always available and allows users to quickly navigate between properties and portfolios at any time. It preserves the user’s current context, so navigating from a specific tab within one property opens the same tab in the destination property.
</Note>

### **To use the search bar**

- Click on the search bar at the top of the application
- Start typing the name of a property or portfolio
  - The search bar will begin to autofill based on your search
  - Matching properties and portfolios will be displayed with distinct colors and icons
- Click on the property or portfolio to which you want to navigate

## Quickly Jump from a Property to Portfolio

Users can quickly jump back up to a group or account from within a property.

<Note>
  Jumping from a property to portfolio maintains the context when applicable. If a user jumps from within a specific tab in a property (e.g. GRESB), they will land in the same tab at the portfolio level. If a tab only exists at the property level, then the user will land in portfolio dashboard tab by default.
</Note>

### **To navigate back to a group or account**

  - Click on the portfolio name
- If the property belongs to multiple groups
  - Click on the arrow icon next to the portfolio name and select the target portfolio
  - Click on the portfolio name after the banner updates

## Quickly Jump from a Portfolio to Property

Users can quickly jump to a property by clicking the property name within any portfolio tab or plot.

<Note>
  Jumping from a property from a portfolio maintains the context when applicable. This means that if a user clicks a property within a specific portfolio-level tab (e.g. GRESB / Measures), they will land in the same tab at the property level.
</Note>

### **To navigate to a property from anywhere in a portfolio**

- Click on the properties link in the property banner to open a sidebar with a list of all properties in the portfolio
- Search for the target property and click on the name

- Within any table or plot (mouse hover), click on the name of the property to which you want to navigate
