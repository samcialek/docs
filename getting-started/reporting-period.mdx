Abisko allows users to set specific 12-month periods over which to view performance metrics and trends across properties and portfolios.

<Tip>
  After logging in, reporting period defaults to the year ending with the most recently completed calendar month. Users should set or confirm their base and reporting periods to ensure they are reviewing data for the intended timeframe.
</Tip>

## Setting the Reporting Period

<Note>
  Once set, base and reporting periods persist throughout the user’s session, even as they navigate between tabs, properties, and portfolios. These periods can be updated at any time.
</Note>

The reporting period can be set from within most tabs.

- Click on the **Reporting Period** button at the top of any relevant tab (below the tab names)

- Select the last month of the target 12-month period over which you want data to be displayed
  - e.g. To view data for 2024 (Calendar Year) select December 2024
    - _This will set the reporting period to 1/1/2024 → 12/31/2024_
  - e.g. To view data for 12-months ending in Q2 2025 select June 2025
