## Session Units

Users can easily configure the units used to display data across tabs, tables, plots, and reports using adjacent dropdown menus. To avoid having to repeatedly change units in different locations, once set, unit selections for each utility type persist throughout the user session.

- e.g. If the energy unit is set to kBtu in one table, then other plots and tables will continue to display energy values in kBtu even as the user navigates to different tabs.

**The following units are available based on utility type:**

| Type      | Unit Options                      |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Energy    | kWh, MWh, kBtu, MBtu, therms      |
| Emissions | kg-CO2e, mt-CO2e, lb-CO2e, t-CO2e |
| Water     | gallon, UKgallon, L, m3           |
| Waste     | lbs, kg, ton, tonne               |

## EXCEL Report Units

Users can generate Excel reports with performance data output in their preferred units. 

- e.g. The **Portfolio Performance & Data Quality Report** can be configured to output values with electricity in kWh, fuel in therms, emissions in kgCO2e as seen in the image below.
