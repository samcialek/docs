## Session Units

Abisko allows users to configure the units used to display values across tabs, tables, plots, and reports. The following unit options can be set by users in various locations throughout the platform.

| Type      | Unit Options                      |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Energy    | kWh, MWh, kBtu, MBtu, therms      |
| Emissions | kg-CO2e, mt-CO2e, lb-CO2e, t-CO2e |
| Water     | gallon, UKgallon, L, m3           |
| Waste     | lbs, kg, ton, tonne               |

To avoid having to repeatedly change units in different locations, once set, unit selections for each performance type (e.g., Energy, Emissions, Water, Waste) persist throughout the user’s session.

- e.g. If the energy unit is set to kBtu in one table, then other plots and tables will continue to display energy values in kBtu even as the user navigates to different tabs.

## EXCEL Report Units

Users can also generate Excel reports with performance data output in their preferred units. For reports, Abisko provides additional flexibility by allowing units to be set at the subtype level.

- e.g. A single report can be configured to generate values with electricity in kWh, fuel in therms, emissions in kgCO2e as seen in the image below.
