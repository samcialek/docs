Primary performance meters (called "in-metric" in ESPM) are the meters selected to represent your building's official energy consumption for benchmarking and reporting purposes. These meters "compute metrics" in Energy Star Portfolio Manager.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** While ESPM reports primary meter data at the whole-building level, Abisko extends this by enabling space-type assignments—you can designate which meters serve common areas vs tenant spaces, even for primary meters.
</Note>

## Why It Matters

Abisko analyzes both primary and supplemental meters together, enabling landlord/tenant splits for GRESB reporting that go beyond ESPM's whole-building approach.

<Tip>
**Example:** A property has one aggregate electric meter (primary/in-metric) for whole building reporting. All tenant submeters are supplemental (out-of-metric). ESPM reports at the whole-building level, while Abisko extends this to enable landlord vs tenant breakdowns.
