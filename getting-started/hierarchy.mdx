## Hierarchy

Users can leverage powerful features for organizing and managing properties across portfolios of all sizes in a multi-tiered hierarchy that allows data to be analyzed at different resolutions.

## User Access

Users can be provided access to any level of the above hierarchy. Once logged in, they can also access all the levels below.

e.g. If a user is provided access to an **Account - Portfolio**, they can access all groups, properties and meters associated with the **Account - Portfolio.**

- After logging in, users with access to a single account will automatically land in their **Account - Portfolio.** From there, they can access all properties and groups within their account.

e.g. If a user is provided access to an **Group - Portfolio**, they can access only properties and meters associated with that specific **Group - Portfolio.**

- After logging in, users with access to a single group will automatically land in their **Group - Portfolio.** From there, they can access all properties within their group.

e.g. If a user is provided access to an **Property**, they can only access that property.

- After logging in, users with access to a single property will automatically land in that property.
- Users with access to multiple, independent properties will land on a dashboard page with a list of all properties to which they have access.

## Groups

Users with **Account - Portfolio** access can create groups to help organize their properties.

Properties can be organized into groups based on geography (e.g. region), property type (e.g. office) or any other attribute (e.g. GRESB fund, BPS policy). This enables quick and targeted views of group-level performance trends, analytics and reports.

<Note>
  Properties can belong to multiple groups at once.
