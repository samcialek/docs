# Quick Start Guide

Get from zero to GRESB export in four steps. This guide assumes you already have an Energy Star Portfolio Manager account with properties and meter data.

<Note>
**Prerequisites:** Active ESPM account with at least one property and 12 months of meter data.
</Note>

## Step 1: Connect Your ESPM Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to Abisko">
    Go to [app.abisko.io](https://app.abisko.io) and sign in or create an account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Energy Star Portfolio Manager**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize in ESPM">
    In Portfolio Manager: **Sharing** → **Share Forward** → Select Abisko as your web services provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete connection">
    Enter your ESPM credentials in Abisko and select properties to sync.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**First sync takes 2-5 minutes** depending on portfolio size. You'll see a progress indicator.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Review Your Data

Once synced, check data quality before proceeding:

| Check | Where to Find | Target |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Data completeness | Dashboard widget | >80% per property |
| Meter assignments | Property → Meters tab | All meters assigned |
| GFA accuracy | Property → Details | Matches lease docs |

<Warning>
**Common Issue:** Properties showing 0% completeness usually have a sync permission issue. Re-authorize in ESPM if needed.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Configure Landlord/Tenant Splits

For accurate GRESB reporting, define who controls each space:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a property">
    Click any property from your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create space types">
    **Space Types** tab → Add base building and tenant spaces with GFA for each.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign meters">
    **Meters** tab → Link each meter to its corresponding space.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set control type">
    For each space, specify landlord vs tenant control.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Bulk Setup:** For portfolios with similar lease structures, configure one property as a template, then apply settings across similar assets.
</Tip>

---

## Step 4: Export for GRESB

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run pre-flight checks">
    **Reporting** → **GRESB** → **Validate** catches issues before export.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select reporting year">
    Choose the calendar year for your submission.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download Asset Spreadsheet">
    Click **Export** to generate the GRESB-formatted Excel file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload to GRESB Portal">
    Log in to your GRESB account and upload the spreadsheet.
  </Step>
</Steps>
