Performance tiers categorize your properties into efficiency groups (e.g., high, medium, low performers) based on benchmarks or absolute metrics. This helps prioritize capital and operational improvements.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM shows individual scores. Abisko groups your portfolio into actionable tiers, showing which properties need attention and which are already high performers.

## Common Tier Frameworks

**By ENERGY STAR Score:**

| Tier | Score Range | Priority |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Green** | 75+ | Certify, maintain |
| **Yellow** | 50-74 | Improve to reach 75 |
| **Orange** | 25-49 | Significant opportunity |
| **Red** | Under 25 | Urgent attention |

**By EUI Quartile:**

| Tier | Position | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Top 25%** | Best performers | Benchmark internally |
| **Middle 50%** | Average | Standard improvements |
| **Bottom 25%** | Laggards | Deep retrofits |

## Using Tiers Strategically

<Tip>
**80/20 Rule:** Often, 20% of your portfolio (bottom tier) represents the majority of improvement potential. Targeting these properties first maximizes portfolio-wide gains.
</Tip>

**Investment Priority Matrix:**

| Tier | Typical Investment | Expected Return |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Red | Major retrofit | High absolute savings |
| Orange | Targeted upgrades | Good ROI |
| Yellow | Operational changes | Quick wins |
| Green | Maintenance only | Preserve performance |
