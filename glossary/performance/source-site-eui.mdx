Site EUI measures energy delivered to your building. Source EUI includes the energy lost in generation and transmission, representing total primary energy consumed. ENERGY STAR and GRESB typically use source EUI for benchmarking.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM reports both site and source EUI. Abisko displays both and lets you toggle between them for trend analysis, while defaulting to source EUI for benchmark comparisons.

## The Difference

```
Site Energy → What the meter reads
Source Energy → What the power plant burned to deliver that energy
```

## Source-to-Site Ratios

| Fuel Type | Ratio | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Electricity (grid) | ~3.0 | 3 units burned for every 1 delivered |
| Natural Gas | ~1.05 | Minimal transmission losses |
| Fuel Oil | ~1.01 | Direct delivery |
| District Steam | ~1.2-1.5 | Varies by system |

<Tip>
**Example:** 
- A building uses 100,000 kBtu electricity (site) and 50,000 kBtu gas (site)
- Site Energy: 150,000 kBtu
- Source Energy: (100,000 × 3.0) + (50,000 × 1.05) = 352,500 kBtu
</Tip>

## Why It Matters

| Scenario | Better Metric |
|----------|---------------|
| On-site efficiency improvements | Site EUI |
| Environmental impact comparison | Source EUI |
| ENERGY STAR scoring | Source EUI |
| Fuel switching analysis | Both |
| Cost analysis | Site EUI + rates |

<Warning>
**Electrification Impact:** Switching from gas to electric heat pumps often increases site EUI but may decrease source EUI due to equipment efficiency gains.
