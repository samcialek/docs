Data completeness measures what percentage of expected meter readings you actually have for a reporting period. GRESB requires high data completeness (typically 80%+) for valid performance submissions.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM shows data completeness at the meter level. Abisko aggregates this across your entire portfolio and flags properties at risk of failing GRESB thresholds before submission deadlines.
</Note>

## How It's Calculated

```
Data Completeness = (Actual Reading Days / Expected Reading Days) × 100%
```

For a 365-day reporting year with 350 days of readings: **96% complete**

<Warning>
**GRESB Threshold:** Properties below 80% data completeness may be excluded from performance scoring or flagged for data quality issues.
</Warning>

## Common Causes of Low Completeness

- Meter installation mid-year
- Utility billing gaps
- Failed API syncs from ESPM
- Properties sold/acquired mid-period

## How to Fix in Abisko

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify gaps">
    Dashboard → **Data Quality** widget shows properties below threshold
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review meter-level detail">
    Click into property → **Meters tab** → sort by "Completeness" column
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use gap-filling">
    For acceptable gaps, apply estimation methods. See [Gap-Filling](/glossary/gresb/gap-filling).
  </Step>
