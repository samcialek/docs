CRREM (Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor) provides science-based decarbonization pathways that show how much energy and carbon your buildings should use each year to align with Paris Agreement climate targets (1.5°C or 2°C scenarios).

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM provides current performance data. Abisko overlays CRREM pathways showing when your properties risk becoming "stranded assets" if they don't improve, giving you a forward-looking climate risk view.

## What CRREM Provides

| Component | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Decarbonization pathways** | Annual targets by property type and country | Long-term planning |
| **Stranding year** | When property exceeds pathway | Risk quantification |
| **Carbon intensity targets** | kgCO2/m²/year thresholds | Performance goals |
| **Energy intensity targets** | kWh/m²/year thresholds | Efficiency planning |

## How CRREM Pathways Work

```
2024: Your office uses 100 kgCO2/m²
       CRREM pathway: 95 kgCO2/m² ← Already exceeding!

2030: CRREM pathway: 65 kgCO2/m²
2040: CRREM pathway: 25 kgCO2/m²
2050: CRREM pathway: ~0 kgCO2/m² (net zero)
```

<Warning>
**Stranding Definition:** A "stranded" building exceeds the CRREM pathway—it's no longer aligned with climate targets and faces transition risks (regulatory, market value, financing).
</Warning>

## CRREM in GRESB Context

GRESB increasingly asks about CRREM alignment:
- Are properties analyzed against CRREM?
- What's the portfolio stranding risk?
- What capital plans address high-risk assets?

## Using CRREM in Abisko

    Chart shows your actual performance against CRREM targets
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Identify stranding year">
    Red zone indicates when property will exceed pathway
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Model interventions">
    Add planned retrofits to see impact on stranding timeline
  </Step>

<Tip>
**Regional Pathways:** CRREM provides country-specific pathways. A building in Germany has different targets than one in the US due to grid carbon intensity and climate.
