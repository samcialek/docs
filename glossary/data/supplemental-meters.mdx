Supplemental meters (called "out-of-metric" in ESPM) are meters tracked in your portfolio but excluded from official ENERGY STAR benchmarking calculations. They're still valuable for complete consumption tracking and GRESB reporting.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** While ESPM excludes supplemental meters from its score, Abisko includes them in landlord/tenant split calculations and total consumption reporting for GRESB.
</Note>

## When Meters Are Supplemental

| Scenario | Why Supplemental | Still Valuable For |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Tenant-paid utilities | Can't verify data | GRESB Scope 3 |
| New meter mid-year | Incomplete period | Trending after install |
| Backup generator | Intermittent use | Total energy accounting |
| EV charging | Separate from building | Transportation reporting |

## Primary vs Supplemental in ESPM

```
ESPM Metric Status:
├── Primary (In-Metric) → Included in ENERGY STAR Score
└── Supplemental (Out-of-Metric) → Tracked but excluded from score
```

<Tip>
**Best Practice:** Keep tenant submeters as supplemental in ESPM (since you may not control data quality) but still import them to Abisko for complete GRESB reporting.
</Tip>

## Managing in Abisko

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sync from ESPM">
    Both primary and supplemental meters import automatically
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Identify metric status">
    **Meters** tab → "Metric Status" column shows designation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign to spaces">
    Supplemental meters can still be assigned to tenant spaces for GRESB splits
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Include in exports">
    GRESB export includes supplemental meter data in Scope 3 calculations
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Data Quality:** Supplemental meters may have lower data quality since they're often tenant-provided. Flag estimated or incomplete data appropriately.
</Warning>
