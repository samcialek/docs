Estimated bills are utility invoices where the consumption value is estimated by the utility company rather than based on an actual meter reading. Common when meters aren't read every month or when readers can't access the meter.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM accepts estimated bills without flagging them. Abisko identifies estimated readings and tracks them separately so you know your data quality before GRESB submission.
</Note>

## How to Identify Estimated Bills

Utilities typically indicate estimates with:
- "E" or "EST" code on invoice
- "Estimated Read" notation
- Unusually round numbers
- Identical values across multiple months

## Impact on Reporting

| Data Type | GRESB Acceptance | Data Quality Flag |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Actual meter read | ✅ Preferred | Green |
| Utility estimate | ✅ Acceptable | Yellow |
| User estimate | ✅ With documentation | Yellow |
| Gap-filled by Abisko | ✅ With methodology | Yellow |

<Warning>
**True-Up Risk:** When the utility does an actual read, they'll adjust the bill. This "true-up" can create data spikes or negative readings in your records.
