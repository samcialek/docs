Meter space assignments connect each meter to the building space(s) it serves. This linkage enables Abisko to calculate landlord/tenant consumption splits and proper scope classifications.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM tracks meters at the property level without space assignments. Abisko lets you assign meters to base building, common areas, or specific tenant spaces—enabling the granular splits GRESB requires.

## Assignment Types

| Assignment | What It Means | GRESB Impact |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Whole Building** | Meter serves entire building | Needs allocation method |
| **Base Building** | Meter serves common areas only | Landlord consumption |
| **Tenant Space** | Meter serves specific tenant | Tenant consumption |
| **Shared** | Meter serves multiple spaces | Proportional allocation |

## Why Assignments Matter

Without assignments:
```
Electric Meter → 100,000 kWh → Whole building (?)
```

With assignments:
```
Electric Meter 1 → 40,000 kWh → Base Building → Landlord Scope 2
Electric Meter 2 → 35,000 kWh → Tenant A → Landlord Scope 3
Electric Meter 3 → 25,000 kWh → Tenant B → Landlord Scope 3
```

## Setting Up Assignments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define spaces first">
    **Property** → **Space Types** → Create base building and tenant spaces
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open meter assignments">
    **Property** → **Meters** → Select meter → **Edit Assignment**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Link to space">
    Choose the space this meter serves from dropdown
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set allocation method (if shared)">
    For meters serving multiple spaces, define split methodology
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Quick Check:** After assignments, verify that all consumption is allocated. Dashboard should show no "unassigned" consumption remaining.
