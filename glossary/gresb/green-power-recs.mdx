Green power refers to electricity from renewable sources (wind, solar, hydro). RECs (Renewable Energy Certificates) are tradeable certificates representing the environmental attributes of renewable generation. Both reduce market-based Scope 2 emissions.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM doesn't track renewable energy purchases. Abisko records REC purchases and green power contracts, applying them to market-based emissions calculations for GRESB reporting.
</Note>

## Types of Green Power

| Type | Description | Emissions Impact |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **On-site solar** | PV panels on building | Reduces consumption + generates RECs |
| **Green tariff** | Utility renewable program | Market-based factor = supplier mix |
| **Unbundled RECs** | Purchased certificates | Apply to market-based calculation |
| **PPA (offsite)** | Power purchase agreement | Bundled RECs from specific project |

## REC Requirements for GRESB

To count RECs toward market-based emissions reduction:

- RECs must be from same reporting year (or vintage within 12 months)
- RECs must be retired (not resold)
- Documentation must show quantity and source
- RECs should match the grid region when possible

<Warning>
**Double Counting:** If you sell RECs from on-site solar, you cannot claim those environmental benefits. The buyer of the REC gets the emissions reduction.
</Warning>
