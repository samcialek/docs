Landlord/tenant control identifies who purchases energy and has operational control over consumption in different parts of a building. This classification determines how consumption gets split in GRESB reporting.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM tracks total building consumption without landlord/tenant breakdowns. Abisko classifies each meter and space by control type, enabling the splits GRESB requires for accurate scope reporting.
</Note>

## Control Types

| Control Type | Who Pays | Who Controls | GRESB Scope |
|--------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Landlord Obtained, Landlord Controlled** | Landlord | Landlord | Scope 1 or 2 |
| **Landlord Obtained, Tenant Controlled** | Landlord (passed through) | Tenant | Scope 3 |
| **Tenant Obtained, Tenant Controlled** | Tenant | Tenant | Scope 3 |
| **Base Building** | Landlord | Landlord | Scope 1 or 2 |

## Common Scenarios

<Tip>
**Triple Net Lease:** Tenant pays all utilities directly → Tenant Obtained, Tenant Controlled → Scope 3 for landlord
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Full Service Gross:** Landlord pays utilities, included in rent → Landlord Obtained, Landlord Controlled → Scope 1 or 2
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Modified Gross:** Landlord pays base building, tenants pay their space → Split by meter assignments
</Tip>

## Assigning Control in Abisko

  <Step title="Navigate to property">
    Select property from portfolio dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open Space Types">
    **Property Setup** → **Space Types** tab
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign control per space">
    For each space (base building, tenant areas), select control classification
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Link meters to spaces">
    Assign meters to spaces so consumption flows to correct control category
  </Step>
