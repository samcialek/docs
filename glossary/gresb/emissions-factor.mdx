An emissions factor is a coefficient that converts energy consumption (kWh, therms, gallons) into carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO2e). Different fuels and electricity grids have different emissions factors.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM applies a single national grid factor. Abisko uses regional eGRID subregion factors for location-based calculations and incorporates your specific utility and renewable contracts for market-based calculations.

## Common Emissions Factors

| Fuel Type | Typical Factor | Units | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|-------|
| Natural Gas | 5.3 | kg CO2e/therm | Combustion only (Scope 1) |
| Electricity (US avg) | 0.4 | kg CO2e/kWh | Varies by grid region |
| Diesel | 10.2 | kg CO2e/gallon | Generators, vehicles |
| Propane | 5.7 | kg CO2e/gallon | Heating, backup |

## Grid Electricity Varies by Region

<Tip>
**Example:** The same 1,000 MWh of electricity produces vastly different emissions:

- **CAMX (California):** 0.23 kg/kWh → 230 tonnes CO2e
- **RFCW (Midwest):** 0.47 kg/kWh → 470 tonnes CO2e
- **NWPP (Pacific NW):** 0.28 kg/kWh → 280 tonnes CO2e
</Tip>

## Location vs Market-Based Factors

| Method | Factor Source | When It Changes |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Location-based** | EPA eGRID regional average | Updated annually by EPA |
| **Market-based** | Supplier-specific or residual mix | Based on contracts and RECs |

## How Abisko Applies Factors

<Steps>
  <Step title="Auto-assign by location">
    Property ZIP code determines eGRID subregion for location-based
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Override if needed">
    For international properties or specific supplier data, enter custom factors
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Apply fuel-specific factors">
    Each meter type (gas, electric, steam) uses appropriate conversion
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Calculate both methods">
    Dashboard shows location and market-based totals using respective factors
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Annual Updates:** eGRID factors update each year. Abisko incorporates new factors when EPA releases them, which may change year-over-year comparisons even for the same consumption.
