The GRESB Asset Spreadsheet is the standardized Excel template that GRESB requires for submitting property-level energy, water, waste, and emissions data. Each row represents one property with dozens of columns for consumption values, coverage percentages, and landlord/tenant splits.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM exports basic consumption data. Abisko auto-populates the full GRESB template including landlord/tenant splits, scope classifications, location vs market-based emissions, and data coverage calculations—all fields ESPM doesn't track.
</Note>

## Key Sections in the Spreadsheet

| Section | What Abisko Fills | Manual Fields |
|---------|------------------|---------------|
| Energy | Consumption by fuel type, L/T splits | None |
| GHG Emissions | Scope 1, 2, 3; location & market-based | None |
| Water | Consumption, coverage % | None |
| Waste | Weight by disposal method | May need manual input |
| Certifications | LEED, ENERGY STAR labels | Verification dates |
