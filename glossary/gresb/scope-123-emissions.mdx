Scope 1, 2, and 3 are GHG Protocol categories that classify carbon emissions based on the source and who controls them. GRESB requires reporting across all three scopes.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM reports total emissions without scope breakdown. Abisko automatically classifies emissions into scopes based on fuel type, meter assignments, and landlord/tenant control settings.
</Note>

## The Three Scopes

| Scope | Source | Building Examples | Landlord Reports When... |
|-------|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Scope 1** | Direct combustion on-site | Natural gas boilers, diesel generators | Landlord controls fuel |
| **Scope 2** | Purchased electricity/steam | Grid electricity, district heating | Landlord purchases power |
| **Scope 3** | Indirect/value chain | Tenant electricity, embodied carbon | Tenant controls consumption |

## How Scopes Apply to Buildings

<Tip>
**Scope 1 Example:** Building has a central gas boiler for heating. Landlord purchases gas and controls the system → Scope 1 emission for landlord.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Scope 2 Example:** Landlord pays the electric bill for common areas → Scope 2 emission for landlord.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Scope 3 Example:** Tenant has their own electric meter and pays directly → Scope 3 emission for landlord (downstream leased asset).
</Tip>

## How Abisko Calculates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify fuel types">
    Each meter tagged with fuel type (electricity, natural gas, etc.)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Apply control classification">
    Based on landlord/tenant control settings per meter/space
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Apply emissions factors">
    Location or market-based factors convert consumption → CO2e
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Aggregate by scope">
    Dashboard and exports show totals by Scope 1, 2, and 3
  </Step>
</Steps>
