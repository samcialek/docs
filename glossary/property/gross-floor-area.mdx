Gross Floor Area (GFA) is the total floor space of a building measured from the exterior walls, including all floors. It's the denominator in energy intensity calculations (EUI) and GRESB reporting.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM uses GFA for benchmarking. Abisko breaks down GFA by space type (base building vs tenant areas) enabling more granular intensity analysis and GRESB splits.
</Note>

## GFA vs Other Area Measures

| Measure | Definition | Typical Use |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **GFA** | Total to exterior walls | Benchmarking, GRESB |
| **NLA/NRA** | Net leasable/rentable | Lease calculations |
| **Conditioned area** | Heated/cooled space | HVAC sizing |
| **Occupied area** | Currently in use | Occupancy adjustments |

## What's Included in GFA

✅ **Include:**
- All floors (above and below grade)
- Common areas (lobbies, corridors)
- Tenant spaces
- Mechanical rooms
- Parking structures (per ESPM rules)

❌ **Exclude:**
- Exterior balconies
- Covered walkways open on sides
- Atriums above first floor

<Tip>
**ESPM Sync:** GFA syncs from Portfolio Manager. If you update GFA in ESPM, refresh the sync to update Abisko.
</Tip>

## Verifying GFA in Abisko

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check property details">
    **Property** → **Details** → Gross Floor Area field
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Compare to lease documents">
    Verify GFA matches building records or appraisals
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review space breakdown">
    **Space Types** tab should sum to total GFA
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update if incorrect">
    Edit in ESPM first, then re-sync to Abisko
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Impact of Errors:** Incorrect GFA directly affects EUI calculations. A building reporting 10% less GFA will appear 10% more energy intensive.
</Warning>
