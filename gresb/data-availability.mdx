Data availability in GRESB context refers to which categories of data (energy, water, waste) you can report for your portfolio. GRESB asks about availability separately from actual values.

## Availability Categories

| Category | What GRESB Asks | How to Respond |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Energy** | Can you report consumption? | Yes if meters exist |
| **Water** | Can you report consumption? | Yes if water meters exist |
| **Waste** | Can you report by disposal type? | Often limited |

## Why Availability Matters

GRESB uses availability responses to contextualize your data:

- **Not available:** No penalty for missing data
- **Available but not reported:** Scored as zero
- **Available and reported:** Full credit possible

<Tip>
**Strategy:** Only indicate "available" for data you can actually provide. Indicating availability without data hurts your score.
