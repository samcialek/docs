Like-for-like analysis compares performance across two time periods using only properties that have complete, comparable data in both years. This eliminates noise from acquisitions, dispositions, and major renovations.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM doesn't track portfolio changes over time. Abisko automatically identifies which properties qualify for like-for-like comparison based on ownership dates, data completeness, and major capital events.
</Note>

## Why Like-for-Like Matters

GRESB scores portfolios on absolute performance AND year-over-year improvement. Like-for-like metrics show genuine operational improvements vs portfolio composition changes.

| Metric Type | What It Shows | Use Case |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Absolute** | Total portfolio consumption | Current footprint |
| **Like-for-Like** | Same-property trend | Operational improvement |
| **Intensity** | Consumption per sq ft | Efficiency regardless of size |

## Qualification Criteria

Properties qualify for like-for-like when:
- Owned for full 12 months in both comparison years
- Data completeness at least 80% in both years
- No major renovations affecting more than 25% of GFA
- Same operational boundary (no tenant mix changes affecting control)

<Warning>
**Common Exclusions:** New acquisitions, properties sold mid-year, and buildings undergoing major retrofits should be excluded from like-for-like comparisons.
