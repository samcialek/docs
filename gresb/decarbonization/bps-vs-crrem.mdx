Building Performance Standards (BPS) and CRREM pathways both set performance targets, but they serve different purposes and may have different timelines. Understanding both helps you plan capital investments effectively.

## Key Differences

| Aspect | BPS | CRREM |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Type** | Regulatory requirement | Voluntary benchmark |
| **Enforcement** | Fines, penalties | No legal consequence |
| **Geography** | Jurisdiction-specific | Global pathways |
| **Timeline** | Policy-driven | Science-based (Paris) |
| **Flexibility** | Limited compliance paths | Multiple scenarios |

## Which Is Stricter?

It depends on location and property type:

<Tip>
**Example - NYC Office:**
- LL97 2024 target: ~50 kgCO2/m²
- CRREM 2024 pathway: ~40 kgCO2/m²
- In this case, CRREM is stricter early, but LL97 2030 targets may be stricter later
</Tip>

## Strategy Implications

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| **BPS stricter than CRREM** | Focus on compliance first |
| **CRREM stricter than BPS** | Meeting CRREM ensures BPS compliance |
| **Similar targets** | Plan for both simultaneously |
| **No BPS in jurisdiction** | Use CRREM as voluntary target |

<Warning>
**Future Regulation:** Even if no BPS exists today, CRREM analysis prepares you for likely future regulations.
</Warning>
