Stranding risk is the likelihood that a building will become a "stranded asset"—one that loses value or becomes obsolete due to climate-related factors like regulations, market preferences, or physical climate impacts.

## Types of Stranding Risk

| Risk Type | Driver | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Regulatory** | Building performance laws | Failing BERDO, LL97, BPS |
| **Market** | Tenant/investor preferences | Tenants avoiding high-carbon space |
| **Financial** | Lending requirements | Banks requiring climate risk disclosure |
| **Physical** | Climate impacts | Flood zones, extreme heat |

## CRREM Stranding Year

The stranding year is when your building's carbon intensity first exceeds the CRREM pathway:

```
Building: 80 kgCO2/m² (current)
Declining pathway crosses 80 kgCO2/m² in 2028
→ Stranding Year: 2028
```

<Warning>
**Earlier = Higher Risk:** A 2025 stranding year means immediate risk. A 2045 stranding year gives more time to plan retrofits.
</Warning>

## Risk Categories

| Stranding Year | Risk Level | Recommended Action |
|----------------|------------|-------------------|
| Already stranded | 🔴 Critical | Immediate retrofit planning |
| Within 5 years | 🟠 High | Budget for major upgrades |
| 5-10 years | 🟡 Medium | Include in capital planning |
| 10+ years | 🟢 Lower | Monitor, plan ahead |
