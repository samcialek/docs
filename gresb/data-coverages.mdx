GRESB data coverages measure what percentage of your portfolio floor area has associated consumption data for energy, water, and emissions. Higher coverage indicates more complete reporting.

## Coverage Types in GRESB

| Coverage | Formula | Target |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Energy** | Area with energy data / Total GFA | 80%+ |
| **GHG Emissions** | Area with emissions data / Total GFA | Matches energy |
| **Water** | Area with water data / Total GFA | 80%+ |

## How Coverage Is Calculated

```
Coverage = Σ(Property GFA with data) / Σ(Total Portfolio GFA) × 100%
```

**Example:**
- Portfolio total: 500,000 sq ft (5 properties)
- Properties with energy data: 400,000 sq ft (4 properties)
- Energy coverage: 80%

## Separate Coverages by Category

GRESB asks for separate coverage for:

| Category | What Counts | Common Gap Reasons |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Landlord energy** | Base building meters | Whole-building only |
| **Tenant energy** | Tenant space meters | Tenant-paid utilities |
| **Water** | Water meters | No separate metering |

<Tip>
**Improvement Strategy:** Adding tenant-obtained data as supplemental meters improves coverage even without direct meter access.
