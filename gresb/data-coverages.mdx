Data coverages in Abisko use a **"current as of"** methodology. This means Abisko always reports the data coverage values from the most recent date *prior to the end* of your selected reporting period.

---

## How It Works

<Note>
**Key Principle:** Abisko finds the data coverage entry with the most recent date that falls before or on December 31 of your reporting year, then uses those values.
</Note>

**Example:** For GRESB 2024 reporting, if you have data coverages dated:
- 1/1/2023
- 6/1/2023  
- 12/31/2023
- 3/1/2024

Abisko reports the **12/31/2023** values — the most recent date before the end of CY 2023.

---

## Locking In Values

If you want to guarantee specific coverage values for a reporting year, set the date to **December 31** of that year.

| Coverage Date | Used For |
|---------------|----------|
| 12/31/2022 | 2022 reporting year |
| 12/31/2023 | 2023 reporting year |
| 12/31/2024 | 2024 reporting year |

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** Since no later date can exist within that calendar year, a 12/31 entry will always be the one reported for that year.
</Tip>

---

## Values Persist Forward

Data coverages carry forward automatically. You don't need to create new entries every year if nothing changes.

**Example:** If you only have two entries:
- 1/1/1900 (legacy default)
- 1/1/2023 (your actual coverage)

Then **both 2023 and 2024** reporting years will use the 1/1/2023 values — it's the most recent date prior to the end of each period.

<Tip>
If you prefer explicit year-by-year records, you can always click **"Add New"** and save copied values with an updated date. This is optional but can help with audit trails.
</Tip>

## Independent of Consumption Data

Data coverages and consumption data are tracked separately.

| Data Type | What It Reports | Time Logic |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Data Coverage** | % of floor area with data | "Current as of" date lookup |
| **Consumption** | Actual energy/water/waste | Calendar year actuals |

This means:
- For 2023 GRESB reporting, **consumption** pulls from CY 2023 meter readings
- For 2023 GRESB reporting, **data coverage** uses the most recent coverage entry dated before 12/31/2023

The two are independent — changing one doesn't affect the other.

## Finding Your Data Coverage Date

In Abisko, navigate to your property's **GRESB Property** tab → **Coverages** subtab. Hover over the info icon to see a message like:

> **Data coverage current as of 1/1/2024**
>
> The data coverage values with the most recent date prior to the end of the selected period is always reported. For the selected GRESB year (2024), the most recent data coverage date is 1/1/2024.
