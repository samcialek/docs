CRREM (Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor) provides science-based decarbonization pathways that show how much energy and carbon your buildings should use each year to align with Paris Agreement climate targets (1.5°C or 2°C scenarios).What CRREM Provides

| Component                    | Description                                 | Use Case            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Decarbonization pathways** | Annual targets by property type and country | Long-term planning  |
| **Stranding year**           | When property exceeds pathway               | Risk quantification |
| **Carbon intensity targets** | kgCO2/m²/year thresholds                    | Performance goals   |
| **Energy intensity targets** | kWh/m²/year thresholds                      | Efficiency planning |

## How CRREM Pathways Work

```
2024: Your office uses 100 kgCO2/m²
       CRREM pathway: 95 kgCO2/m² ← Already exceeding!

2030: CRREM pathway: 65 kgCO2/m²
2040: CRREM pathway: 25 kgCO2/m²
2050: CRREM pathway: ~0 kgCO2/m² (net zero)
```

<Warning>
  **Stranding Definition:** A "stranded" building exceeds the CRREM pathway—it's no longer aligned with climate targets and faces transition risks (regulatory, market value, financing).
</Warning>
