## **Property Types**

- **Building**: A single physical property.
- **Campus**: A logical property composed of one or more child properties (e.g. buildings).

## **Meter Relationships**

Meters may be configured to have different relationships to properties.

<Warning>
  Abisko currently only supports campus configurations from ESPM. In Abisko, there is no way to set a meter as 'in-metric' for a property that does not own the meter. This functionality is coming soon.
</Warning>

- **'Owned' meters**

  Meters that are physically installed on and/or owned by a property. Owned meters can be 'in-metric' or 'out-of-metric' for the property on which they are located.

  <Note>
    When a meter is created in Abisko (or ESPM) it is automatically considered owned by that property in which it was created.
  </Note>
- **'In-metric' meters**

  Meters that contribute to a property’s whole-building (or whole-property) performance metrics, regardless of ownership.

  <Note>
    Metes can be configured as 'in-metric' to a property, even if the meter belongs (aka is 'owned') to a different property profile.
  </Note>

**Ownership and 'in-metric' status are independent. A property may:**

- Own meters that are not 'in-metric'.
- Have meters that it does not own but are 'in-metric'.

## **Examples: Campus & Child Property Meter Configurations**

An example of a campus with multiple child properties with different meter configurations.

![Group 1000002809](/images/Group1000002809.png)

- **'Campus A' Property:** The campus property above owns no meters while having 5 'in-metric' meters that are owned across multiple child properties.
  - Campus-level 'Whole building' performance metrics are calculated based on its 5 'in-metric' meters that are owned by its two child properties.
- **Child properties** are managed independently with their own 'owned' & 'in-metric' meters.
  - **Building 1:** Has 4 owned meters, of which 3 are 'in-metric'.
    - Building 1 'Whole building' performance metrics are calculated based on its 3 'in-metric' meters.
    - Building 1 has also has 3 owned meters that are 'in-metric' for Campus A and contribute to the 'Whole Building' performance metrics of Campus A.
  - **Building 2:** Has 2 owned meters, of which only 1 is 'in-metric'.
    - Building 2 'Whole building' performance metrics are calculated based on its 1 'in-metric' meter.
    - Building 2 has also has 2 owned meters, both of which are 'in-metric' for Campus A and contribute to the 'Whole Building' performance metrics of Campus A.
