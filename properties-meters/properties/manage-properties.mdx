## Add a new property

- **To create a new property in Abisko**

  2. Click on 'Add Property' at the top of the sidebar
  4. Add or edit property attributes and save
- **ESPM Properties**

<Note>
  All properties shared via **ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager®** (ESPM) will automatically sync every night with Abisko, ensuring that property data is always up-to-date.
</Note>

## Edit Property Attributes

Properties contain a range of information that is tracked for different reporting purposes. Some information (e.g. data bought/sold) impacts how performance metrics are calculated, while other data (e.g. GRESB Property Type) is used for a very specific purpose.

Abisko categorizes property attributes into basic (static) attributes and advanced attributes that vary over time or by space type.

## Basic Attributes

Required and optional fields when creating new and editing existing properties.

- **Navigate to Property → Click 'Edit' Button in the property banner (top-right)**

  > <Warning>
  >   For ESPM properties, the following fields must be edited directly in ESPM.
  > </Warning>
  > - **Property Name** _(required)_
  >   - For ESPM properties, an optional **Nickname** field is provided to allow users to set a different display name in Abisko.
  > - **Country** _(required)_
  > - **Street Address** _(required)_
  > - **City** _(required)_
  > - **State** _(required)_
  > - **Postal Code** _(required)_
  > - **Gross Floor Area** _(required)_
  > - **Property Type** _(required)_
  - **Year Built** _(optional)_
  - **Date Bought** _(optional)_: The date the property was bought or came under management.
  - **Date Sold** _(optional)_: The date the the property was sold or disposed.

  <Note>
    The ownership period (date bought to date sold) defines the time range over which property performance is calculated and reported. Any meter or performance data collected outside of this ownership period is excluded from all metrics and reports.
  </Note>
  - **GRESB Property Type** _(optional)_: GRESB property types differ from those of Abisko & ESPM and therefore a separate field is provided.
  - **Percent Ownership** _(optional)_
  - **Gross Asset Value** _(optional)_
  - **Data Partners** _(optional)_: A list of organizations or individuals who contribute to the property's data collection efforts. This enables targeted analysis at the portfolio-level.
  - **External IDs** (optional): Abisko allows users to track IDs to external data providers (e.g. GRESB, Yardi) to help them cross-reference data across platforms.
