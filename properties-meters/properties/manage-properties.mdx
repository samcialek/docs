</Note>

## Edit Property Attributes

Properties contain a range of information that is tracked for different reporting purposes. Some information (e.g. data bought/sold) impacts how performance metrics are calculated, while other data (e.g. GRESB Property Type) is used for a very specific purpose.

Abisko categorizes property attributes into basic (static) attributes and advanced attributes that vary over time or by space type.

## Basic Attributes

Required and optional fields when creating new and editing existing properties.

- **Navigate to Property → Click 'Edit' Button in the property banner (top-right)**

  > <Warning>
  >   For ESPM properties, the following fields must be edited directly in ESPM.
  > </Warning>
  > - **Property Name** _(required)_
  >   - For ESPM properties, an optional \*\*Nickname \*\*field is provided to allow users to set a different display name in Abisko.
  > - **Country** _(required)_
  > - **Street Address** _(required)_
  > - **City** _(required)_
  > - **State** _(required for USA & Canada)_
  > - **Postal Code** _(required)_
  > - **Gross Floor Area** _(required)_
  > - **Property Type** _(required)_
  - **Year Built** _(optional)_
  - **Date Bought** _(required)_: The date the property was bought or came under management.
  - **Date Sold** _(optional)_: The date the the property was sold or disposed.

  <Note>
    The ownership period (date bought to date sold) defines the time range over which property performance is calculated and reported. Any meter or performance data collected outside of this ownership period is excluded from all metrics and reports.
  </Note>
  - **GRESB Property Type** _(optional)_: GRESB property types differ from those of Abisko & ESPM and therefore a separate field is provided.
  - **Percent Ownership** _(optional)_
  - **Gross Asset Value** _(optional)_
  - **Data Partners** _(optional)_: A list of organizations or individuals who contribute to the property's data collection efforts. This enables targeted analysis at the portfolio-level.

## Advanced Attributes

### **Gross Floor Area** **(GFA)**

- Allows users to view a history of changes to GFA, which impact intensity-based performance metrics, such as Site EUI, WUI, GHGi.

  <Warning>
    For Abisko properties, only the self-reported gross floor area (GFA) is displayed. For ESPM properties, the full history of EPA-calculated GFA values is also shown; these values are derived from the sum of floor areas across all property uses tracked in ESPM.
  </Warning>
  - **To view 'Gross Floor Area'**
    - **Navigate to Property → Click 'Size' text link in the property banner**
      - Each value is effective from its associated date until superseded by a subsequent entry. The most recent entry is displayed at the top and represents the current value as of its effective date.
      - The oldest value will always be the self-reported GFA value.

### **Vacancy Rate (%) & Number of Occupants**

- Allows users to track vacancy rate and average occupancy over time. Each value is effective from its associated date until superseded by a subsequent entry. The most recent entry is displayed at the top and represents the current value as of its effective date.
  - **To edit: Navigate to Property → Click 'Vacancy' text link in the property banner**

### **Construction Status**

- Allows users to track construction status over time. Each value is effective from its associated date until superseded by a subsequent entry. The most recent entry is displayed at the top and represents the current value as of its effective date.

  <Note>
    To enforce consistency, only GRESB options (e.g. New Construction, Major Renovation, Standing Investment) are available.  All properties default to a contruction status of 'Standing Investment'.
  </Note>
- **To edit: Navigate to Property → Click 'Construction Status' text value in the property banner**

  <Warning>
    The 'Construction Status' link is located to the left of 'Vacancy' and displays the current status rather than an explicit 'Construction Status' label.
  </Warning>

  <Warning>

    - **Navigate to Property → Click 'Property Uses' text link in the property banner next to Property Type  (only shows for ESPM properties)**
