Properties are the foundation of your Abisko portfolio. Each property synced from ESPM contains building characteristics, meter data, and space configurations that drive your GRESB reporting.

## Property Data Flow

```
ESPM Property → Abisko Sync → Configure Spaces → Assign Meters → GRESB Export
```

Properties pull base data from ESPM, but Abisko adds the landlord/tenant framework and space-level detail that GRESB requires.
