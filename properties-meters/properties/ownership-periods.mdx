Ownership periods define when your organization owned or controlled a property. GRESB and other reporting frameworks require consumption data only for the periods you owned the asset.

<Note>
**Why It Matters:** If you acquired a property mid-year, you should only report consumption from the acquisition date forward. Ownership periods ensure your data boundaries are accurate.
</Note>

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Acquisition Date** | When you took ownership/control | Reporting start date |
| **Disposition Date** | When you sold/transferred | Reporting end date |
| **Standing Investment** | Owned full reporting year | Full year data required |
| **Partial Year** | Acquired or sold mid-year | Pro-rated data |

## Setting Ownership Periods

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to property">
    Select property from portfolio dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open ownership settings">
    **Property** → **Details** → **Ownership Period**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set acquisition date">
    Enter the date your organization took control
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set disposition date (if applicable)">
    Enter sale date if property was disposed
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Impact on Reporting

<Tip>
**Like-for-Like:** Only properties owned for the full 12 months in both comparison years qualify for like-for-like analysis.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Data Completeness:** Ownership periods affect how completeness is calculated. A property acquired July 1 only needs 6 months of data to achieve 100% completeness for that year.
</Warning>
