Space types are classifications that divide a building into distinct areas based on operational control and ownership. GRESB uses space types to understand who controls consumption in different parts of your properties.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM tracks property-level use types (office, retail) but not space-level control classifications. Abisko adds the landlord/tenant space framework GRESB requires for proper scope reporting.
</Note>

## GRESB Space Classification

| Space Type | Description | Typical Control | GRESB Scope |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Whole Building** | Single occupant, full control | Varies | Based on lease type |
| **Base Building** | Common areas, core systems | Landlord | Scope 1 or 2 |
| **Tenant Space** | Leased areas | Depends on lease | Often Scope 3 |
| **Shared Services** | Amenities, parking | Landlord | Scope 1 or 2 |

## Setting Up Space Types

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Space Types">
    **Property** → **Space Types** tab
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add base building">
    Create space for common areas with GFA and landlord control designation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add tenant spaces">
    Create separate space for each major tenant or tenant category
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify GFA totals">
    Sum of all space types should equal total building GFA
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Configurations

**Multi-Tenant Office:**
```
Total GFA: 100,000 sq ft
├── Base Building: 30,000 sq ft (Landlord Controlled)
├── Tenant A: 40,000 sq ft (Tenant Controlled)
└── Tenant B: 30,000 sq ft (Tenant Controlled)
```

**Single-Tenant Industrial:**
```
Total GFA: 200,000 sq ft
└── Whole Building: 200,000 sq ft (Tenant Controlled - NNN Lease)
```

**Mixed-Use with Retail:**
```
Total GFA: 150,000 sq ft
├── Base Building: 25,000 sq ft (Landlord)
├── Office Tenant: 100,000 sq ft (Tenant)
└── Retail Tenant: 25,000 sq ft (Tenant)
```

<Tip>
**Meter Alignment:** After setting up space types, assign meters to each space. This enables automatic consumption allocation for GRESB exports.
