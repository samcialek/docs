Base building refers to the common areas and core building systems that remain under landlord operational control regardless of tenants. This includes lobbies, corridors, mechanical systems, elevators, and central plants.

<Note>
**How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** ESPM reports whole-building consumption. Abisko separates base building from tenant spaces, enabling the landlord consumption calculations GRESB requires.

## What's Typically Base Building

| Component | Base Building? | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Lobby, corridors | ✅ Yes | Common area |
| Central HVAC plant | ✅ Yes | Core system |
| Elevators | ✅ Yes | Shared infrastructure |
| Exterior lighting | ✅ Yes | Common area |
| Tenant HVAC (rooftop unit) | ❌ Usually tenant | If dedicated to one tenant |
| Tenant lighting | ❌ No | Within tenant space |
| Restrooms | ✅ If shared | May be tenant if private |

## Base Building in GRESB Context

GRESB wants to know:
1. **Total consumption** (whole building)
2. **Base building portion** (landlord-controlled)
3. **Tenant portion** (tenant-controlled, often Scope 3)

```
Whole Building = Base Building + Tenant Spaces
```

<Tip>
**Typical Split:** In a multi-tenant office, base building often represents 25-40% of total energy consumption, covering HVAC central plant, common areas, and elevators.

## Setting Up in Abisko

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create base building space">
    **Property** → **Space Types** → Add "Base Building" space type
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter square footage">
    GFA of common areas and mechanical spaces
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign meters">
    Link meters serving base building systems to this space
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set control type">
    Mark as "Landlord Obtained, Landlord Controlled"
  </Step>
</Steps>
