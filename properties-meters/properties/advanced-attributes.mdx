## Property Attributes

Beyond basic attributes such as property name, type, and ownership period, Abisko allows users to track advanced operational data that changes over time, as well as detailed information related to property uses and their associated attributes.

### **Gross Floor Area** **(GFA)**

The **Gross Floor Area** impacts intensity-based performance metrics, such as Site EUI, WUI, GHGi. Abisko enables users to track GFA from multiple sources.

<Note>
  Abisko tracks **Self-reported GFA** and **Property Use GFA** values. To maximize consistency with ESPM, Abisko uses the **Property Use GFA** values when available to calculate intensity metrics.
</Note>

- **Self-reported - GFA**: This value is available for all properties (Abisko, ESPM) and can be updated at any time. However, no history of changes is saved.
- **Property Use - GFA (ESPM only)**: These values are only available for ESPM properties and are derived from the sum of floor areas across all property uses. Values change any time any floor area of any ESPM property use changes. A full history of values can be viewed in the platform. [Jump to Property Uses](#property-uses)
- **To view 'Gross Floor Area'**
  - **Navigate to Property →** _Click 'Size' text link in the property banner_
    - The sidebar that opens contains all applicable GFA values for the property.
      - Each value is effective from its associated date until superseded by a subsequent entry. The most recent entry is displayed at the top and represents the current (i.e. today's) value as of its effective date.
      - For Abisko properties, users will only see the property's **Self-reported GFA** value.
      - For ESPM properties, users can view a mix of **Self-reported GFA** and **Property Use GFA** values, which may change over time. The oldest value will always be the self-reported GFA value.

### **Vacancy Rate & Number of Occupants**

Track vacancy and occupancy rates at a property over time. Each value is effective from its associated date until superseded by a subsequent entry. The most recent entry is displayed at the top and represents the current (i.e. today's)  value as of its effective date.

- **To add/edit/delete values**
  - **Navigate to Property →** _Click 'Vacancy' text link in the property banner_
    - **To add a new entry**
      - Enter the values for the **Date, 'Vacancy (%)' and '# of Occupants'** at the top of the sidebar and click save
    - **To edit an entry**
      - Hover the mouse over the row in the table for the entry you would like to edit
      - Click the pen icon that shows itself on the right side of the row
      - Update the fields in the row and click the checkmark icon to save
    - **To edit or delete an entry**
      - Hover the mouse over the row in the table for the entry you would like to delete
      - Click the trash icon that shows itself on the right side of the row

### **Construction Status**

Track construction status over time. Each value is effective from its associated date until superseded by a subsequent entry. The most recent entry is displayed at the top and represents the current value as of its effective date.

<Note>
  To enforce consistency, only GRESB options (e.g. New Construction, Major Renovation, Standing Investment) are available.  All properties default to a contruction status of 'Standing Investment'.
</Note>

- **To add/edit/delete values**
  - **_Navigate to Property → Click 'Construction Status' text value in the property banner_**

    <Warning>
      The 'Construction Status' link is located to the left of 'Vacancy' and displays the current status rather than an explicit 'Construction Status' label.
    </Warning>
    - **To add a new entry**
      - Enter the values at the top of the sidebar and click save.
    - **To edit an entry**
      - Hover the mouse over the row in the table for the entry you would like to edit
      - Click the pen icon that shows itself on the right side of the row
      - Update the fields in the row and click the checkmark icon to save
    - **To edit or delete an entry**

### **Property Uses**

Property uses and their associated details are critical for properties subject to Building Performance Standard (BPS) policies, as these policies often derive performance baselines and targets from property use classifications and attributes. These property uses and their details also directly impact Energy Star certification and scoring.

<Note>
  Currently only available for ESPM properties.
</Note>

- **To view 'Property Uses'**
  - **_Navigate to Property → Click 'Property Uses' text link in the property banner_**
    - Hover the mouse over any individual property use to see a list of all associated property use details

  <Warning>
    \_Property uses cannot be edited in Abisko. They must be edited directly in ESPM. \_
  </Warning>
