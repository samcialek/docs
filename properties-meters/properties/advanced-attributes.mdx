## Advanced Attributes

### **Gross Floor Area** **(GFA)**

- Allows users to view a history of changes to GFA, which impact intensity-based performance metrics, such as Site EUI, WUI, GHGi.

  <Warning>
    For Abisko properties, only the self-reported gross floor area (GFA) is displayed. For ESPM properties, the full history of EPA-calculated GFA values is also shown; these values are derived from the sum of floor areas across all property uses tracked in ESPM.
  </Warning>
  - **To view 'Gross Floor Area'**
    - **Navigate to Property → Click 'Size' text link in the property banner**
      - Each value is effective from its associated date until superseded by a subsequent entry. The most recent entry is displayed at the top and represents the current value as of its effective date.
      - The oldest value will always be the self-reported GFA value.

### **Vacancy Rate (%) & Number of Occupants**

- Allows users to track vacancy rate and average occupancy over time. Each value is effective from its associated date until superseded by a subsequent entry. The most recent entry is displayed at the top and represents the current value as of its effective date.
  - **To edit: Navigate to Property → Click 'Vacancy' text link in the property banner**

### **Construction Status**

- Allows users to track construction status over time. Each value is effective from its associated date until superseded by a subsequent entry. The most recent entry is displayed at the top and represents the current value as of its effective date.

  <Note>
    To enforce consistency, only GRESB options (e.g. New Construction, Major Renovation, Standing Investment) are available.  All properties default to a contruction status of 'Standing Investment'.
  </Note>
- **To edit: Navigate to Property → Click 'Construction Status' text value in the property banner**

  <Warning>
    The 'Construction Status' link is located to the left of 'Vacancy' and displays the current status rather than an explicit 'Construction Status' label.
  </Warning>

### **Property Uses**

Property uses and their associated details are critical for properties subject to Building Performance Standard (BPS) policies, as these policies often derive performance baselines and targets from property use classifications and attributes. These uses and details also directly impact a property's Energy Star Score and its potential for certification.

Abisko allows users to view a detailed breakdown of all property uses and their details.

<Warning>
  Currently only available for ESPM properties.
</Warning>

- **To view 'Property Uses'**
  - \*\*Navigate to Property → Click 'Property Uses' text link in the property banner \*\*
    - To view 'Property Use Details': In the sidebar, hover mouse over any property use to see a list of all property use details and their associated values
