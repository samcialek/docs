Abisko enables users to effectively annotate, tag and organize information for different purposes within a property. This includes searchable, time-based **notes** as well as a flexible **canvas** for more generic and free-form annotations.

## Notes

The **Notes** widget allows users to track events and other time-based occurrences that may impact property performance.

<Tip>
  Notes are particularly useful for capturing information about performance anomalies or missing data. They can be referenced later to explain anomalies in historical performance or used as supporting evidence during data review and auditing processes.
</Tip>

Each note requires an associated date and a short description of the event. Users may also assign one or more tags to provide additional context, enabling notes to be searched by date or description and filtered by tag. Tags also allow Abisko to intelligently display relevant notes within applicable plots and reports.

The plot below displays notes as gray markers along the x-axis of a monthly energy use chart. Users can hover over any marker to view the note’s description and associated date.

Notes can provide explanations for observed trends and missing data or simply be used to keep track of information that impacts the property.

For example, notes can be used to track:

- **Operational disruptions**
  - _Sample tags: "Lease", "Tenant", "Operation", "Construction"_
  - e.g. _“Tenant A terminated lease 2 months early”_, _“Floor 4 vacated for 2 weeks due to renovation”, “Reduced operating hours (9-1pm) for July 4th weekend”_
- **Data-related events**
  - _Sample tags: "Meter", "Energy", "Operation", "Performance"_
  - e.g. _“Partner has not found missing bill for Meter 123 for October”, “Utility did not sync data for Jan-March”_
- **Performance anomalies**
  - _Sample tags: "Meter", "Energy", "Performance", "CRREM"_
  - e.g. _“Meter 3 jumped 20% between March and April due to new lighting installation“, “CRREM stranding year decreased 3 years”_
- **Compliance & reporting updates**
  - _Sample tags: "BPS", "GRESB", "Property Uses", "Operation"_
  - e.g. _“City granted a new BPS limit for 2027 deadline”, “Corrected error in annual tenant total for GRESB”, “Certification not granted due to missing document”_

**Property-level tags include:**

Performance, Property, Tenant, Energy, Emissions, Water, Waste, Operation, Construction, Lease, Meter, Certification, Assessment, Measure, Air Quality, Compliance, GRESB, CRREM, BERDO, Local Law 97, Energize Denver, Seattle BEPS, Colorado BPS, Washington CBPS, 2030 Districts.
