<Note>
  Abisko enables volume to mass waste conversions by using factors published by the EPA ([see here](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-04/documents/volume_to_weight_conversion_factors_memorandum_04192016_508fnl.pdf)). Waste is also disaggregate by disposal type and hazardous/non-hazardous categories.
