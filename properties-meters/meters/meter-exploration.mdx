## Exploring Meter Data

<Note>
  The Meter Exploration tab allows users to explore monthly and annual performance trends across any combination of meters and spaces.
</Note>

- **Navigate to Property → Meters → Energy / Emissions / Water / Waste**
  - All 'in-metric' meters are toggled on by default to view whole building performance trends
  - Toggle on/off any meter to update the meters included in the plots and tables below
    - The meter table includes the [Meter Name, Subtype, In-Metric Status, Space Assignment] for each meter to help users make their selection

- **Plot Options & CSV Download**: In the top right of the monthly plot
  - Dropdown: Select the desired data series to plot monthly cost or consumption totals

    <Note>
      Only available for energy & water meters
    </Note>

  - Hamburger Icon: Click to generate a CSV export with all monthly values for each meters
- **Plot Legend Options**
  - Toggle on/off any of the additional series that are included in the plot
    - Series #1: Total in-metric consumption/emissions/waste

      <Tip>
        The dashed orange line in the monthly plot represents the whole building total based on all 'in-metric' meters. This reference line is always available in the plot regardless of which meters are selected to allow users to compare selected meter totals with reported whole building consumption.
      </Tip>
    - Series #2: All relevant measures (energy/water) completed during the selected periods
    - Series #3: All property notes with dates during the selected periods

### Annual Trends

Below the main plot, the meter exploration tab displays annual totals for each meter along with other useful information.
