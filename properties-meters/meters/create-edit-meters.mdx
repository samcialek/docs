## To create a meter in Abisko

<Note>
  **ESPM Meters** For properties synced from ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager® (ESPM), meters must be created, edited or deleted directly in ESPM. All meter updates will automatically appear in Abisko after the **nightly sync**.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Property → Meters → Energy / Water / Waste">
    Click on 'Add Meter' button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete the required fields in the sidebar">
    Click save and close.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Meter Attributes:**

The following required and optional fields are set when creating an Energy or Water meter:

- **Meter Type** _(required)_: The type of energy or water meter (e.g. electricity, gas, propane).
- **Meter Name** _(required)_: Custom name for the meter.
- **Units** _(required)_: The units in which the meter entries are input (kWh, therms, liters).
- **Included in Metrics** _(required)_: If the meter is included in Whole Building performance calculations ([learn more](/properties-meters/meters/meter-status)).
- **Activation Date** _(required)_: The date the meter came online and performance metrics begin. Only data after the activation date will be included in performance metrics.
- **Deactivation Date** _(optional)_: The date the meter went offline and performance metrics end. Only data before the deactivation date will be included in performance metrics.
- **Notes** _(optional)_: Any additional notes associated with the meter.

### **Additional Waste Meter Attributes:**

Waste meters include all fields for energy and water meters, plus:

- **Waste Material** _(required)_: The material property of the waste (e.g. beverage containers, batteries, building materials, electronics, plastics).
- **Date Entry Method** _(required)_: How the waste data is tracked and entered in Abisko.
  - **Regular**: Similar to energy/water meters with regular entries
  - **Intermittent**: Meters for infrequent or 1-time events (e.g. annual donation of electronics)
  - **Container**: Based on the size of a container, # of times it is emptied and fill percentage
    - Example entry: [Containe Volume: 3m2; Times Emptied: 5; Average Fill Rate: 75%)

<Note>
  Abisko uses volume to mass conversion factors published by the EPA ([see here](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-04/documents/volume_to_weight_conversion_factors_memorandum_04192016_508fnl.pdf)) to normalize all waste meter data. It also disaggregates waste entries by disposal types and hazardous and non-hazardous categories to enable seamless reporting.
