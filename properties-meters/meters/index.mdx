Meters are the source of all energy, water and waste consumption data, which is used to calculate property and portfolio-level performance metrics (e.g. Total Energy, Site EUI). Meter data can come from a variety of sources and can be enriched to enable more complex reporting.

## Meter Data Flow

```
ESPM Meter → Abisko Sync → Assign to Space → Control Classification → GRESB Scope
```

The key step Abisko adds is assigning meters to spaces with control types, which determines how consumption flows into GRESB scope categories.
