Meters are the source of your consumption data. Abisko syncs meters from ESPM and adds the space-level assignments and status tracking that enable accurate GRESB reporting.

## Meter Data Flow

```
ESPM Meter → Abisko Sync → Assign to Space → Control Classification → GRESB Scope
```

The key step Abisko adds is assigning meters to spaces with control types, which determines how consumption flows into GRESB scope categories.
