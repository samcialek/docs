Abisko tracks three categories of meters aligned with GRESB reporting requirements: energy, water, and waste. Each type has specific units, conversion factors, and reporting considerations.

## Energy Meters

| Fuel Type | Common Units | Scope | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|-------|
| **Electricity** | kWh | 2 (or 3 if tenant) | Most common |
| **Natural Gas** | therms, ccf, MMBtu | 1 | On-site combustion |
| **Fuel Oil** | gallons | 1 | Backup/heating |
| **District Steam** | Mlbs, MMBtu | 2 | Campus/urban |
| **District Chilled Water** | ton-hrs | 2 | Cooling |
| **Propane** | gallons | 1 | Rural properties |

<Tip>
**Unit Conversion:** Abisko automatically converts all energy to kBtu for standardized reporting and EUI calculations.
</Tip>

## Water Meters

| Type | Common Units | Reporting |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Potable Water** | gallons, kgal, ccf | GRESB water consumption |
| **Irrigation** | gallons | Often separate meter |
| **Reclaimed Water** | gallons | Counts toward efficiency |

## Waste Meters

| Type | Common Units | Reporting |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Landfill** | tons, lbs | GRESB waste |
| **Recycling** | tons, lbs | Diversion rate |
| **Compost** | tons, lbs | Diversion rate |
| **Hazardous** | tons, lbs | Separate tracking |

<Note>
**GRESB Waste Reporting:** GRESB asks for waste by disposal method. Track recycling and compost separately from landfill to calculate diversion rates.
