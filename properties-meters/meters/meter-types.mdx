Abisko enables users to track all energy, water and waste meters owned and associated with each property. Each meter type has several options for subtypes with corresponding units, conversion factors, and reporting considerations.

<Note>
  Abisko allows users to set any compatible unit for collecting energy, water and waste data. All data is normalized automatically to enable users to analyze and report performance metrics in **any unit that they choose.**
</Note>

## Energy Meters

Abisko offers 19 different energy meter subtypes. Consumption values for all energy subtypes impact emissions metrics, except for "Other", because there is no corresponding emissions factor.

<Tip>
  Energy meters are aggregated by subtype (see below) or type (Electric, Fuel and District Hearting & Cooling) depending on the reporting requirements.
