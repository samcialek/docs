Abisko lets users to simultaneously track all meters associated with a property, including aggregate, partial and tenant submeters. This enables users to maintain a single property profile to satisfy multiple reporting requirements based on whole building and space (landlord vs. tenant) performance metrics.

## In-Metric vs. Out-of-Metric Meters

All meters that are configured as ‘in-metric’ are included in whole building performance and data quality metrics. Meters that are not 'in-metric' are considered to be 'out-of-metric' and do not contribute to whole building metrics. To learn how to set a meter as 'in-metric', [click here](/properties-meters/meters/manage-meters).

| **Status**        | **Whole Building Metrics** | **Space Metrics**                          |
| :---------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **In-Metric**     | ✅ Included                 | Not Applicable - Based on Space Assignment |
| **Out-of-Metric** | ❌ Excluded                 | Not Applicable - Based on Space Assignment |

<Note>
  Many reporting requirements (Benchmarking, BPS, CRREM) are based on whole building metrics.

The following Abisko tabs are each based on performance metrics that are derived from 'in-metric' meters. 'Spaces' tabs are not listed as they are driven by meter space assignments, which do not depend on 'in-metric' status.

## How to Configure Meters?

Meter configurations all depend on what meters are being tracked and used for reporting. The following scenarios present meter configurations based on the meters that are available.

**Scenario A: Aggregate meters with no tenant submeters**

<Note>
  A property only has whole building aggregate meters for each utility. This is a common scenario where properties gain access to aggregate meters for benchmarking and compliance purposes.
</Note>

```
Aggregate Meters
├── Electric Meter: in-metric
├── Natural Gas: in-metric
```

- All aggregate meters should be set as 'in-metric'
- All meters will contribute to whole building performance metrics
- Whole building data coverage is 100% for each aggregate meter utility type

**Scenario B: Partial meters with no aggregate meters**

<Note>
  The property has no aggregate meters but is tracking base building and/or tenant submeters, which it wants to use to report whole building performance and data coverage.
</Note>

```
Partial Building Meters
├── Common Areas - Electric Meter #1: in-metric
├── Common Areas - Electric Meter #2: in-metric
├── Tenant Space - Electric Meter #3: in-metric
├── Tenant Space - Electric Meter #4: in-metric
├── Shared Services - Natural Gas #1: in-metric
├── Shared Services - Natural Gas #2: in-metric
```

- All partial meters should be set as 'in-metric'
- All meters will contribute to whole building performance metrics
- Whole building & split data coverage is tracked and reported separately
  - Whole building data coverage may be less than 100% even if base building or tenant space data coverage is 100%

**Scenario C: Aggregate meters & tenant submeters**

<Note>
  A property is tracking both aggregate meters and tenant submeters and meters can be configured to simultaneously report whole building and space (landlord vs. tenant) performance metrics.
</Note>

```
Partial Building Meters
├── Aggregate - Electric Meter: in-metric
├── Aggregate - Natural Gas Meter: in-metric
├── Common Areas - Electric Meter #1: out-of-metric
├── Common Areas - Electric Meter #2: out-of-metric
├── Tenant Space - Electric Meter #3: out-of-metric
├── Tenant Space - Electric Meter #4: out-of-metric
├── Shared Services - Natural Gas #1: out-of-metric
├── Shared Services - Natural Gas #2: out-of-metric
```

- All aggregate meters should be set as 'in-metric'
  - In-metric meters will contribute to whole building performance metrics
- All partial (base building & tenant) submeters should be set as 'out-of-metric'
  - Out-of-metric meters can be assigned to space types to report space performance metrics
- Whole building & split data coverage is tracked and reported separately
  - Whole building data coverage is 100% for each utility type with an aggregate meter
  - Base building and tenant space data coverages vary by submeter coverage
