Meter status indicates whether a meter is "in-metric" (primary, used for benchmarking) or "out-of-metric" (supplemental, tracked but excluded from ENERGY STAR scores).

<Note>
  **How Abisko Expands from ESPM:** Both meter types sync from ESPM. Abisko uses supplemental meters for GRESB reporting even though ESPM excludes them from benchmarking.
</Note>

## Status Types

| Status            | ESPM Term    | Benchmarking        | GRESB Use                   |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **In-Metric**     | Primary      | ✅ Included in score | Whole building baseline     |
| **Out-of-Metric** | Supplemental | ❌ Excluded          | Tenant consumption, Scope 3 |

## Primary vs Supplemental Flow

```
ESPM Metric Status:
├── Primary (In-Metric) → Included in ENERGY STAR Score
└── Supplemental (Out-of-Metric) → Tracked but excluded from score
                                 → Still used in Abisko for GRESB splits
```

<Tip>
  **Best Practice:** Keep tenant submeters as supplemental in ESPM (since you may not control data quality) but still import them to Abisko for complete GRESB reporting.
</Tip>

## Common Property-Meter Configurations

**Configuration A: Full Submetering**

- Master meter at utility entrance
- Every tenant has dedicated submeter
- Base building has separate meter(s)
- _Abisko can fully allocate landlord vs tenant_

```
Master Meter (Utility Account)
├── Submeter: Common Areas
├── Submeter: Tenant A
├── Submeter: Tenant B
└── Submeter: Tenant C
```

**Configuration B: Partial Submetering**

- Master meter only
- Some tenants submetered, others estimated
- _Abisko calculates base building as: Master - Σ(submeters)_

```
Master Meter (Utility Account)
├── Submeter: Common Areas
├── Submeter: Tenant A
├── Submeter: Tenant B
└── Submeter: Tenant C
```

**Configuration C: No Submetering**

- Master meter only
- Allocation by square footage or lease terms
- _Less accurate but GRESB-acceptable with documentation_

```
Master Meter (Utility Account)
├── Submeter: Common Areas
├── Submeter: Tenant A
├── Submeter: Tenant B
└── Submeter: Tenant C
```

## Viewing Status in Abisko

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sync from ESPM">
    Both primary and supplemental meters import automatically
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check status column">
    **Property** → **Meters** tab → "Metric Status" column
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign to spaces regardless of status">
    Both in-metric and out-of-metric meters can be assigned to spaces
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Data Quality:** Supplemental meters may have lower data quality since they're often tenant-provided. Flag estimated or incomplete data appropriately.
</Warning>
