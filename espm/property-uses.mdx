Property uses are the building characteristics ESPM uses to calculate expected energy consumption and ENERGY STAR scores. These details sync to Abisko and affect benchmark comparisons.

## Key Property Use Details

| Detail | Impact | Examples |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Primary function** | Determines benchmark model | Office, Retail, Multifamily |
| **Weekly operating hours** | Expected consumption | 40, 60, 168 (24/7) |
| **Number of workers** | Occupant load | 50, 500, 2000 |
| **% Heated/Cooled** | Climate impact | 80%, 100% |
| **Number of computers** | Plug loads | 100, 1000 |
| **Data center presence** | High-intensity space | Yes/No + sq ft |

## How ESPM Uses These

```
Your Building:
- Office, 100,000 sq ft
- 50 hours/week
- 200 workers
- Full HVAC

ESPM Expected Model:
- Based on regression of similar buildings
- Adjusts for your specific characteristics
- Generates expected consumption

ENERGY STAR Score:
- Your actual vs expected
- Score 1-100 based on percentile
```

## Accuracy Matters

<Warning>
**Score Impact:** Wrong property use details = wrong expected consumption = misleading ENERGY STAR score. A building reporting 168 weekly hours (24/7) will show a better score than the same building reporting 50 hours.
</Warning>
