## Enable 2-way ESPM sync for meters

The following section only applies for properties being tracked in ESPM, for which Abisko allows users to configure meters to enable 2-way syncing so that all meter data can be updated on-demand and all data entry can take place in Abisko.

### Configure ESPM meter to enable 2-way sync

To configure a meter for 2-way syncing with ESPM, manager level users must first edit the meter.

- **Navigate to Property → Meters → Energy / Water / Waste**
  - Hover the mouse over the row in the table for the meter entry you would like to enable
  - Click the edit icon that shows itself on the right side to open the sidebar
  - Check the 'Enable ESPM Sync' checkbox and save

  <Warning>
    Only 'manager' level users can configure ESPM meters for 2-way sync.
  </Warning>

### Sync entries from an ESPM meter on-demand

After a meter is configured for 2-way ESPM syncing, all users can sync the meter on-demand to capture any recent changes to entries made in ESPM.

- **Navigate to Property → Meters → Energy / Water / Waste**
  - Click on the name of the meter for which you would like to sync entries
  - Scroll to below the meter information and meter data plot
  - Click the 'Sync ESPM Entries' checkbox
    - The loading spinner will stop spinning after all entries are synced with ESPM
  - If the meter plot does not automatically update, click on 'Refresh Analytics' at the top of the meter entry page to update the plot and performance metrics
