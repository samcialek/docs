<Card title="Property GFA – Calculated (Buildings)" href="https://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/pm/glossary#PropertyGFASelfReported">
  Property GFA - Calculated (Buildings) is the sum of the GFA of all the Property Uses that you entered on the Details tab, excluding parking. This is the GFA used to calculate your Energy Use Intensity (EUI), or energy per square foot. This number should match your “Property GFA – Self-Reported.” If you have Property Uses that change square footage frequently (like office space going vacant), this is a good check to make sure all of your Property Uses add up to the right number. This value is time weighted.

<Card title="Property GFA – Calculated (Buildings and Parking)" href="https://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/pm/glossary#PropertyGFASelfReported">
  Property GFA - Calculated (Buildings and Parking) is the sum of the GFA of all the Property Uses that you entered on the Details tab plus all three types of parking GFA. This value is time weighted.

<Card title="Last Modified Date – Property" href="https://energystar.my.site.com/PortfolioManager/s/article/Last-Modified-Metrics-What-types-of-edits-trigger-an-update-1748913487947">
  Last Modified Date – Property: This includes any changes to your property. Changes include property name, address, Number of Workers, Gross Floor Area, Standard and Custom IDs, Baseline Dates, new meter consumption data, etc. "Saving" data, even if there wasn't an actual edit, will count as an update to this field. Sharing, transferring, and reporting, does not trigger an update to this field.
</Card>

<Card title="Cooling Degree Days (CDD)">
  Cooling Degree Days (CDD) - CDD is the equivalent number of days you would have to cool your building by 1 degree to accommodate the cooling requirement. For example, if you have a day on which the temperature is 80°F degrees, that day is worth 15 Cooling Degree Days because it is 15 degrees above 65°F. CDD is calculated in this way for each day of the year and summed up to get the total annual CDD.
</Card>

<Card title="Heating Degree Days (HDD)">
  Heating Degree Days (HDD) - HDD is the equivalent number of days you would have to heat your building by 1 degree to accommodate the heating requirement. For example, if you have a day on which the temperature is 55°F degrees, that day is worth 10 Heating Degree Days because it is 10 degrees below 65°F. HDD is calculated in this way for each day of the year and summed up to get the total annual HDD.
</Card>

<Card title="ENERGY STAR Score">
  A 1–100 ENERGY STAR score lets you understand how the energy performance of your building or plant compares to similar buildings nationwide. A score of 50 represents median performance. A score of 75 or higher means your building may be eligible for ENERGY STAR certification.
</Card>

<Card title="Site Energy Use">
  Site Energy Use is the annual amount of all the energy your property consumes, regardless of the source. It is expressed in kBtu (thousand British thermal units) and includes all sources of energy used on-site.
</Card>

<Card title="Weather Normalized Site Energy Use">
  Weather Normalized Site Energy Use is the site energy your property would have used under 30-year average weather conditions. This helps you compare year-over-year changes without weather skewing the results.
</Card>

<Card title="Site EUI">
  Site Energy Use Intensity (Site EUI) is the amount of energy consumed per square foot of gross floor area at your property. It is calculated by dividing the total site energy by the gross floor area.
</Card>

<Card title="Weather Normalized Site EUI">
  Weather Normalized Site EUI is the site energy use intensity your property would have under 30-year average weather conditions. This metric allows fair comparisons over time or across properties in different climates.
</Card>

<Card title="Electricity Use – Grid Purchase">
  The amount of electricity that your property purchases from the grid. This excludes any electricity generated onsite from renewables.
</Card>

<Card title="Electricity Use – Generated from Onsite Renewable Systems and Used Onsite">
  The amount of electricity generated from onsite renewable energy systems (such as solar panels or wind turbines) and used directly at your property.
</Card>

<Card title="Natural Gas Use">
  The amount of natural gas your property uses, measured in terms of energy content (kBtu). Includes natural gas purchased for heating, cooling, or other end uses.
</Card>

<Card title="Green Power - Onsite">
  Onsite green power includes renewable electricity generated at your property that qualifies as “green” under EPA’s Green Power Partnership guidelines.
</Card>

<Card title="Green Power - Offsite">
  Offsite green power includes renewable electricity your property purchases from a third party that qualifies under EPA’s Green Power Partnership guidelines.
</Card>

<Card title="Total (Location-based) GHG Emissions">
  The total GHG emissions associated with the property's energy use, calculated using the location-based method which reflects the average emissions intensity of the regional electricity grid.
</Card>

<Card title="Direct GHG Emissions">
  Direct GHG emissions come from fuels burned onsite, such as natural gas for heating or onsite combustion generators.
</Card>

<Card title="Indirect (Location-based) GHG Emissions">
  Indirect GHG emissions result from electricity consumption. The location-based method uses average emissions factors for the region where the property is located.
</Card>

<Card title="Indirect (Market-based) GHG Emissions">
  Indirect GHG emissions using the market-based method reflect emissions associated with electricity purchases and any contractual instruments (e.g., RECs, green tariffs).
</Card>

<Card title="Water Use (All Water Sources)">
  The total amount of water used by your property from all sources including municipal, well, and other onsite systems.
</Card>

<Card title="Water Use Intensity (All Water Sources)">
  Water Use Intensity (WUI) is the total water consumption divided by the gross floor area of the property, helping normalize usage for size comparisons.
</Card>

<Card title="Diverted Materials">
  Materials that are diverted from landfills or incineration through recycling, composting, or reuse programs.
</Card>

<Card title="Disposed Waste">
  Waste sent to a landfill or incineration and not diverted through recycling or composting.
</Card>

<Card title="Recycled Materials">
  Waste materials that have been separated and sent for recycling.
</Card>

<Card title="ENERGY STAR Certification – Year(s) Certified with Scores">
  Lists the years the property earned ENERGY STAR certification along with the associated ENERGY STAR scores.
</Card>

<Card title="ENERGY STAR Certification – Last Approval Date">
  The most recent date that your property received ENERGY STAR certification approval.
</Card>

<Card title="ENERGY STAR Certification – Next Eligible Date">
  The earliest future date that your property is eligible to apply for ENERGY STAR certification again.
</Card>
