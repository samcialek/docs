<Card title="Property GFA – Calculated (Buildings)" href="https://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/pm/glossary#PropertyGFASelfReported">
  Property GFA - Calculated (Buildings) is the sum of the GFA of all the Property Uses that you entered on the Details tab, excluding parking. This is the GFA used to calculate your Energy Use Intensity (EUI), or energy per square foot. This number should match your “Property GFA – Self-Reported.” If you have Property Uses that change square footage frequently (like office space going vacant), this is a good check to make sure all of your Property Uses add up to the right number. This value is time weighted.

<Card title="Cooling Degree Days (CDD)">
  Cooling Degree Days (CDD) - CDD is the equivalent number of days you would have to cool your building by 1 degree to accommodate the cooling requirement. For example, if you have a day on which the temperature is 80°F degrees, that day is worth 15 Cooling Degree Days because it is 15 degrees above 65°F. CDD is calculated in this way for each day of the year and summed up to get the total annual CDD.
</Card>

<Card title="Heating Degree Days (HDD)">
  Heating Degree Days (HDD) - HDD is the equivalent number of days you would have to heat your building by 1 degree to accommodate the heating requirement. For example, if you have a day on which the temperature is 55°F degrees, that day is worth 10 Heating Degree Days because it is 10 degrees below 65°F. HDD is calculated in this way for each day of the year and summed up to get the total annual HDD.
