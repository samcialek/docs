ESPM calculates several performance metrics that sync to Abisko, including ENERGY STAR scores, Site/Source EUI, and greenhouse gas emissions.

## Key ESPM Metrics

| Metric | Range | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **ENERGY STAR Score** | 1-100 | Percentile ranking vs similar buildings |
| **Site EUI** | kBtu/sf | Energy delivered to building |
| **Source EUI** | kBtu/sf | Including generation losses |
| **GHG Emissions** | tonnes CO2e | Total carbon footprint |
| **Water Use** | kgal | Total water consumption |

## ENERGY STAR Score Details

The 1-100 score represents how your building compares to similar buildings nationally:

| Score | Meaning | Certification |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 75-100 | Top quartile | Eligible for ENERGY STAR |
| 50-74 | Above median | Not eligible |
| 25-49 | Below median | Improvement needed |
| 1-24 | Bottom quartile | Significant opportunity |

<Tip>
**Score Eligibility:** Not all property types can receive an ENERGY STAR score. Eligible types include offices, retail, hotels, K-12 schools, and several others. Warehouses and industrial buildings don't have scoring models.
