Abisko imports data from Energy Star Portfolio Manager through the EPA's web services API. This connection syncs your property details, meter readings, and scores automatically.

## What Gets Imported

| Data Type          | Import Frequency     | Notes                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Property details   | On connect + refresh | Address, GFA, year built  |
| Meter metadata     | On connect           | Fuel type, units, status  |
| Meter readings     | Daily (if updated)   | Consumption values        |
| ENERGY STAR scores | Monthly              | When available            |
| Property uses      | On connect           | Operating characteristics |

## Sync Troubleshooting

| Issue              | Cause                  | Fix                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Properties missing | Not shared with Abisko | Re-authorize in ESPM     |
| Old data           | Sync hasn't run        | Manual refresh in Abisko |
| Connection failed  | Credentials expired    | Re-authorize annually    |

<Warning>
  **Annual Re-authorization:** ESPM web services sharing expires annually. Re-authorize each year to maintain sync.
