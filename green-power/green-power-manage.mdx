## Onsite Green Power & RECs

Onsite green power metrics are derived from onsite wind and solar meters that generate renewable electricity that is used onsite or exported to the grid. REC ownership for this generated electricity is tracked at the meter level and determines how green power is reported.

### Managing REC ownership

**Navigate to Property → Meters → Click on the meter name**

<Warning>
  Users must click into an electric onsite solar or wind meter. No other meter types contain RECs.
</Warning>

**To add an entry:**

1. Click on **RECs** using the toggle located above the **Add Entry** button

   <Note>
     For ESPM properties, entries must be managed in ESPM.
   </Note>
2. Click the **Add REC** button to open the sidebar
3. Enter all required **REC ownership** details ([_see below_](#rec-ownership-details)) and click **save**

**To edit an entry:**

1. Click on **RECs** using the toggle located above the **Add Entry** button
1. Hover the mouse over the row in the table for the entry you would like to edit
2. Click the **edit icon** that shows itself on the right side to open the sidebar
3. Edit REC fields and click **save**

**To delete an entry:**

1. Click on **RECs** using the toggle located above the **Add Entry** button
1. Hover the mouse over the row in the table for the entry you would like to edit
2. Click the **trash icon** that shows itself on the right side to delete

### REC Ownership Details

The following fields are tracked for each REC ownership entry.

- **Current as of date** - _The date from which the REC ownership status will apply._

  <Note>
    The ownership status will continue to apply until a subsequent entry in which it changes
  </Note>
- **REC ownership status**:
  - for electricity consumed onsite: [Owned, Sold, Arbitraged, Unknown]
  - for electricity exported to the grid: [Owned, Sold, Arbitraged, Unknown]
- **Green-e Certification** - _If the purchased green power is green-e certified_
- **Attachments** (_optional_) - _Attach documents certifying green power RECs_

## Offsite Green Power Purchases

Offsite green power refers to renewable electricity procured from external sources.

**Navigate to Property → Green Power → Green Power Purchases**

**To add a green power purchase:**

1. Click on the **Add Purchase** button in the top-right of the tab

   <Note>
     For ESPM properties, green power purchases must be managed in ESPM.
   </Note>
2. Enter the details for the green power purchase ([_see below_](#green-power-purchase-details))
3. Click **Save**

**To edit a green power purchase:**

1. Hover the mouse over the row in the table for the entry you would like to edit
2. Click the **edit icon** that shows itself on the right side to open the sidebar
3. Edit the green power purchase details and click **save**

**To delete a green power purchase:**

1. Hover the mouse over the row in the table for the entry you would like to edit
2. Click the **trash icon** that shows itself on the right side to delete

### Green Power Purchase Details

The following fields are required when adding a new green power purchase.

- **Start Date**
- **End Date**
- **Amount**
  - **Fixed Amount** - _The amount of green power purchased_
  - **Percentage** - _The percentage of consumption associated with one or more meters that can be counted as offsite green power over the purchase period_

    <Tip>
      The percentage option allows users to easily track the amount of green power associated with meters under specific utility contracts without having to retroactively calculate and enter the amount of green power.\
      \
      **e.g. A direct purchase contract may stipulate that 50% of all electricity provided from a utility is generated from renewable sources.**
    </Tip>
- **Estimated Value** - _if the amount is estimated_
- **Location** - _the offsite location where the green power is generated_
- **Green-e Certification** - _If the purchased green power is green-e certified_
- **Type** - _The type of green power contract or vehicle_

| Type                               | Definition                                                                                                                                          |
| :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) | A local or regional program that procures electricity on behalf of customers, often offering higher renewable content than standard utility supply. |
| Community Solar                    | A shared solar project that allows customers to receive renewable energy credits or bill benefits without installing onsite generation.             |
| Direct Purchase Contract           | A contract to purchase renewable electricity directly from a specific generation facility, typically through a utility or third-party provider.     |
| Virtual PPA                        | A financial contract that settles renewable energy attributes and price differences without physical delivery of electricity to the buyer.          |
| Physical PPA                       | A long-term contract that includes the physical delivery of renewable electricity from a generation facility to the buyer.                          |
| Unbundled REC                      | A renewable energy certificate purchased separately from electricity, representing the environmental attributes of renewable generation.            |
| Utility Green Tariff               | A utility-offered program that allows customers to procure renewable electricity through a dedicated tariff or rate structure.                      |
| Other                              | Any green power procurement mechanism not captured by the categories above.                                                                         |
