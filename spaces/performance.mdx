Performance metrics are automatically calculated using a powerful analytics engine that enables users to analyze monthly and annual performance trends across meters, spaces, properties, and portfolios.

## Performance Metrics

The following section outlines the away monthly and annual performance metrics are calculated.

The diagram below shows how data is rolled up from meters associated to a specific space type to provide higher-level performance insights.

### Methodology

<Steps>
  <Step title="All energy meters associated with a space type are collected">
    - For whole building performance metrics all **in-metric** meters are used.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meter consumption is normalized into common units & calendar months">
    Consumption entries between meter activation & deactivation dates and property buy and sell dates are broken down and reconstituted into monthly values for each meter. Data outside of these boundaries is ignored.

    <Note>
      For bulk delivery energy meters (e.g. Fuel Oil), all energy associated with the entry is attributed to the month in which the fuel was delivered.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly consumption values are aggregated by meter type & subtype">
    Meters are grouped by subtype and higher-level types, to enable performance metrics at multiple resolutions.

    <Accordion title="Energy meter types and subtypes" icon="sparkles">
      | Subtype                | Type     |
      | ---------------------- | -------- |
      | Electric               | Electric |
      | Electric on Site Solar | Electric |
      | Electric on Site Wind  | Electric |
      | Natural Gas            | Fuel     |
      | Diesel                 | Fuel     |
      | Fuel Oil No 1,2,4,5,6  | Fuel     |
      | District Steam         | DHC      |
      | District Hot Water     | DHC      |
      | District Chilled Water | DHC      |
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly consumption data is aggregated over rolling 12-month periods">
    For the whole building and every meter type and subtype, monthly normalized values are rolled up to provide monthly & annual metrics for every possible 12-month reporting period.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Values are further rolled up into portfolio-level insights.">
    Monthly and annual consumption values are aggregated across all properties to enable portfolio-level views.
  </Step>
