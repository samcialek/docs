### Space Types

In addition to whole-building performance metrics based on in-metric meters, users can assign meters to specific space types.  Performance metrics are automatically calculated for each space type using all assigned meters to enable users to analyze performance trends for individual space types, as well as for selected combinations of space types.

**e.g.** Users can track performance trends separately for **Common Areas** and **Shared Services**, as well as for **Landlord Spaces**, which represent the combined consumption across both space types.

The diagram below displays all the space types for which performance trends can be analyzed as well as how space types combine to provide additional higher-level insights.
