## In-Metric vs. Out-of-Metric Meters

Abisko lets users to simultaneously track all meters associated with a property, including aggregate, partial and tenant submeters. This enables a single property profile to be used to satisfy multiple reporting requirements based on whole building and space-based metrics.

<Note>
  Many reporting requirements (e.g. Benchmarking, BPS, CRREM) are based on whole building metrics while others (e.g. GRESB) allow users to report space-based (i.e. landlord vs. tenant) performance.

## Whole Building Metrics

All energy, water and waste meters set as **in-metric** are included in whole building performance and data quality metrics. Meters that are not **in-metric** are considered to be **out-of-metric** and do not contribute to whole building metrics. [Click here](/properties-meters/meters/manage-meters) to learn how to configure meters.

| **Status**        | **Whole Building Metrics** | **Space Metrics**                          |
| :---------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **In-Metric**     | ✅ Included                 | Not Applicable - Based on Space Assignment |
| **Out-of-Metric** | ❌ Excluded                 | Not Applicable - Based on Space Assignment |

The following lists contains whole building metrics that are based on **in-metric** meters:

## Sample Meter Configurations

Meter configurations depend on what meters are available to be tracked and used for reporting. The following scenarios present meter configurations and their associated reporting outcomes.

**Scenario A: Whole building (aggregate) meters with no tenant submeters**

<Note>
  A property may have whole building (aggregate) meters that represent total consumption across all meters and spaces in the building. This is a common scenario in jurisdictions with benchmarking and BPS reporting policies.
</Note>

```
Whole Building (Aggregate) Meters
├── Electric meter: in-metric
├── Natural Gas meter: in-metric
```

- All whole building (aggregate) meters should be set as **in-metric**
- All meters will contribute to whole building performance metrics
  - _Electric meter contributes to 'Total Electricity' for the whole building_
  - _Natural Gas meter contributes to 'Total Fuel' for the whole building_
  - _Both meters contribute to 'Total Energy' & 'Site EUI'_
- Whole building data coverage is 100% for electricity and fuel because the **in-metric** meters are aggregate meters.

**Scenario B: Partial meters with no aggregate meters**

<Note>
  A property may have no whole building (aggregate) meters but is tracking base building and tenant submeters, some of which it wants to use for reporting whole building metrics.
</Note>

```
Partial Building Meters
├── Common Areas - Electric Meter #1: in-metric
├── Common Areas - Electric Meter #2: in-metric
├── Tenant Space - Electric Meter #3: in-metric
├── Tenant Space - Electric Meter #4: out-of-metric
├── Shared Services - Natural Gas #5: in-metric
├── Shared Services - Natural Gas #6: in-metric
```

- Some meters are set as **in-metric** while others are **out-of-metric**
- All **in-metric** meters contribute to whole building performance metrics
  - _Electric Meters #1, #2, #3 contribute to 'Total Electricity' for the whole building_
    - _<u>Electric Meter #4 is excluded from whole building metrics</u>_
  - _Natural Gas Meters #1, #2 contribute to 'Total Fuel' for the whole building_
  - _Meters #1, #2, #3, #5, #6 contribute to 'Total Energy' & 'Site EUI'_
- Whole building & split data coverage is tracked and reported separately
  - Whole building data coverage may be less than 100% even if base building or tenant space data coverage is 100%

**Scenario C: Aggregate meters & tenant submeters**

<Note>
  A property may track both whole building (aggregate) and tenant submeters and want to simultaneously report whole building, landlord and tenant space performance metrics.
</Note>

```
Partial Building Meters
├── Whole Building (Aggregate) - Electric Meter: in-metric
├── Whole Building (Aggregate) - Natural Gas Meter: in-metric
├── Common Areas - Electric Meter #1: out-of-metric
├── Common Areas - Electric Meter #2: out-of-metric
├── Tenant Space - Electric Meter #3: out-of-metric
├── Tenant Space - Electric Meter #4: out-of-metric
├── Shared Services - Natural Gas #1: out-of-metric
├── Shared Services - Natural Gas #2: out-of-metric
```

- All whole building (aggregate) meters should be set as **in-metric**
  - In-metric meters will contribute to whole building performance metrics
    - _Aggregate electric meter contributes to 'Total Electricity' for the whole building_
    - _Aggregate natural gas meter contributes to 'Total Fuel' for the whole building_
    - _Both aggregate meters contribute to 'Total Energy' & 'Site EUI'_
- All partial (base building & tenant) submeters should be set as **out-of-metric**
  - Out-of-metric meters can be assigned to space types to report space performance metrics
- Whole building & split data coverage is tracked and reported separately
  - _Whole building electricity data coverage = 100% because of the aggregate meter_
  - _Whole building fuel data coverage = 100% because of the aggregate meter_
  - Base building and tenant space data coverages vary by submeter coverage
