## Assigning Meters to Spaces

All meters, regardless of being 'in-metric' or 'out-of-metric', can be assigned to a space type to enable [space-based performance reporting](/performance/spaces/landlord-tenant-control) and [scope 1,2,3 emissions reporting](/performance/emissions/scope-123). There are multiple ways to assign meters to spaces.

- **Option #1: Navigate to Property → Meters**
  - [Edit a meter](/properties-meters/meters/manage-meters)
  - Select 'Space Assignment' from the dropdown in the sidebar and save
- **Option #2: Navigate to Property → Spaces**
  - Click on the 'Assign Meters' button.
  - In the 'Meter Space Assignments' sidebar:
    - Select the space type using the dropdown next to each meter

      <Tip>
        For whole building meters, select 'Exclude from Analysis' to preclude double counting them and submeters when calculating space-based performance metrics.
      </Tip>

### **Space Assignments Types**

Meters can be assigned to any space type in the table below or excluded from all space-based analysis by selecting 'Exclude from Analysis'.

<Note>
  Abisko allows all meters, even those imported from ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager®, to be individually assigned to different space types.
