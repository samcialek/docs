## Spaces

All meters, regardless of whether they are in-metric or out-of-metric, can be assigned to space types to support [space-based performance](/spaces/performance) reporting and [Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions reporting](/performance/scope-emissions). This enables users to track data coverage and performance by space type, as well as to understand differences between base building (landlord) and tenant-controlled spaces.

### Space Assignments Types

Meters can be assigned to the space types in the table below or excluded from all space-based analysis by selecting _Exclude from Analysis_.

| Space Type                                         | Control Type |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :----------- |
| Base Building - Common Areas                       | Landlord     |
| Base Building - Shared Services                    | Landlord     |
| Tenant Spaces - Landlord Controlled                | Landlord     |
| Tenant Spaces - Tenant Controlled                  | Tenant       |
| Outdoor / Exterior / Parking - Landlord Controlled | Tenant       |
| Outdoor / Exterior / Parking - Tenant Controlled   | Tenant       |
| EV Charging                                        | N/A          |
| _Exclude from Analysis_                            | _N/A_        |

A few notes about Outdoor / Exterior / Parking meter assignments:

- Only electricity & fuel can be assigned to outdoor spaces.
- When **Reporting Level = Whole Building**, only out-of-metric meters can be assigned to outdoor areas because all in-metric meters are used for whole building reporting.

## Assigning Meters to Spaces

There are multiple ways to assign meters to spaces.

- **Option #1: Navigate to Property → Meters**
  - [Edit a meter](/properties-meters/meters/manage-meters)
  - Select **Space Assignment** from the dropdown in the sidebar and save
- **Option #2: Navigate to Property → Spaces**
  - Click on the **Assign Meters** button.
  - In the **Meter Space Assignments** sidebar:
    - Select the space type using the dropdown next to each meter

      <Tip>
        For whole building meters, select **Exclude from Analysis** to preclude double counting them and submeters when calculating space-based performance metrics.
      </Tip>
